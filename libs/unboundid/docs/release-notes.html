              <h2>Release Notes</h2>

              <h3>Version 1.1.6</h3>

              <p>
                The following changes were made between the 1.1.4 and 1.1.5 releases:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Fixed an error in the documentation for the ContentSyncRequestControl that
                  indicated a response timeout of -1 should be used instead of the correct
                  recommendation of 0.  A value of 0 indicates that no timeout should be used,
                  while -1 indicates that the connection-level timeout (5 minutes by default)
                  should be used.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Fixed the way that RDNs are created when decoding a DN from a string.
                  Previously, RDNs created in this way were treated in a way that could cause
                  extra spaces to be removed from their string representation.  While the resulting
                  RDN was technically equivalent to the expected version, the user-provided string
                  representation should have been retained.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the source code for the Android LDAP client to match the 1.1 version
                  published in the Android market.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>


              <h3>Version 1.1.5</h3>

              <p>
                The following changes were made between the 1.1.4 and 1.1.5 releases:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Added support for the content synchronization operation as defined in RFC 4533,
                  including the various controls and the intermediate response needed to interact
                  with servers supporting this feature.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Fixed a couple of bugs in the way that SSL handshaking is performed to make it
                  more robust, particularly when used over higher-latency network links.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Fixed a bug that could prevent an unbind request from being sent to the server
                  when closing a connection that had previously been closed and re-established.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p></p>


              <h3>Version 1.1.4</h3>

              <p>
                The following changes were made between the 1.1.3 and 1.1.4 releases:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Fixed a bug in the way that the LDAP SDK performed SSL or StartTLS negotiation
                  when using synchronous mode.  As a result of this bug, a race condition created a
                  condition in which the connection could be terminated with an error if any part
                  of the negotiation process took longer than 50 milliseconds.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added a new <tt>search-and-mod-rate</tt> tool that can be used to perform
                  searches as quickly as possible while also modifying each entry returned from
                  those searches.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added a new Launcher class that can be used to invoke the various command-line
                  utilities without needing to use the associated shell scripts.  This is primarily
                  a convenience that makes it possible to use the tools when only the LDAP SDK jar
                  file is available.  The tools can be invoked using a command like:
                  <blockquote>
                    <tt>java -jar unboundid-ldapsdk-se.jar </tt><i>{tool-name} {tool-args}</i>
                  </blockquote>
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the ldapsearch tool to add the ability to perform the same search
                  multiple times using a specified interval.  This can be useful, for example, to
                  repeatedly retrieve a server monitor entry at regular intervals.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the ldapsearch tool to add a terse mode that can be used to minimize the
                  output that it generates to include only minimal content.  It will exclude the
                  connect message, and entry and reference counts.  Further, all such messages
                  written in non-terse mode will be prefixed with "#" characters so that the entire
                  output will be valid LDIF.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the traditional and thread-local connection pool implementations to
                  provide the ability to define the minimum length of time that should pass between
                  connection closures because they have been established for longer than the
                  maximum connection age.  This can help avoid cases in which a large number of
                  connections are closed and re-established in a short period of time.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the LDAP SDK to provide a more useful exception in the event that the
                  connection is terminated as a result of an error encountered while trying to read
                  a response from the server.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Improved the searchrate, modrate, and authrate tools so that they are better able
                  to handle the case in which the connection to the server is lost or the server
                  becomes unavailable.  The tools will attempt to re-establish the connections
                  when the server again becomes available.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated several parts of the LDAP SDK to reduce the amount of memory allocation
                  performed and the amount of garbage created during processing.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added a missing space between the numeric value and name in the string
                  representation of a result code.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p></p>


              <h3>Version 1.1.3</h3>

              <p>
                The following changes were made between the 1.1.2 and 1.1.3 releases:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Added support for LDAP transactions as defined in RFC 5805.  This includes
                  support for the start and end transaction extended requests and results, the
                  transaction specification request control, and the aborted transaction
                  unsolicited notification.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added a new <tt>LDAPConnection.getActiveOperationCount</tt> method, which can be
                  used to obtain the number of operations that have been started but not yet
                  completed on that connection.  This will only be valid for connections that are
                  established and not operating in synchronous mode.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added a new <tt>searchForEntry</tt> method to the <tt>LDAPInterface</tt>
                  interface (and therefore for individual connections and connection pools) that
                  can be used to perform a search expected to return a single entry in a manner
                  that is more convenient than other search methods.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added a number of convenience methods that make it easier to manipulate the
                  content of an add request request like an entry.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the schema parsing code to be more lenient when attempting to parse
                  definitions which violate the specification.  In particular, it will now accept
                  OIDs surrounded in single quotes or OID lists not followed by spaces.  Even
                  though these are not allowed according to the LDAP specification, Active
                  Directory generates schema elements exhibiting these problems.  With these
                  changes, the LDAP SDK can now parse Active Directory schema elements.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the <tt>CommandLineTool</tt> API to provide methods for getting access to
                  the output and error streams to allow for more complex use than simply printing
                  messages to the terminal.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Fixed a potiential bug in the value normalization code which could cause a string
                  index out of range exception when attempting to normalize a value containing only
                  non-ASCII space characters.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Fixed a bug in the <tt>EntryValidator</tt> class that could cause it to throw a
                  null pointer exception when attempting to process an entry that does not have any
                  object classes.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Fixed a bug in which a debug message for an LDIF read is inadvertently written as
                  if it were an LDIF write.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the searchrate tool so that it provides an asynchronous mode that can be
                  used to have multiple outstanding requests on a single connection.  When
                  operating in this mode, it is necessary to use either the existing
                  "<tt>--ratePerSecond</tt>" or the new "<tt>--maxOutstandingRequest</tt>" argument
                  to restrict the number of concurrent outstanding requests.  The total number of
                  connections to establish will still be controlled by the number of client
                  threads.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the source for the Android LDAP client to reflect the code used for the
                  1.0 release available in the Android Market.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p></p>


              <h3>Version 1.1.2</h3>

              <p>
                The following changes were made between the 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 releases:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Improved the behavior of the <tt>AttributeTypeDefinition</tt> class so that it
                  can better deal with attribute type definitions whose syntax element contains
                  the optional minimum upper bound component.  The <tt>getSyntaxOID()</tt> method
                  still returns the complete syntax OID (including the minimum upper bound, if
                  present), but a new <tt>getBaseSyntaxOID()</tt> method has been added that can
                  be used to obtain the syntax OID without the minimum upper bound, and a
                  <tt>getSyntaxMinimumUpperBound()</tt> method has been added that can be used to
                  obtain the minimum upper bound (or -1 if no minimum upper bound is defined).
                  In addition, the <tt>Schema.getAttributeSyntax</tt> method has been updated so
                  that it will ignore any minimum upper bound portion that may be included in the
                  provided OID.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added a new <tt>Entry.diff</tt> method that makes it possible to indicate
                  whether you want the resulting modifications to be reversible.  If the
                  modifications should be reversible (which was always the case in the past), then
                  the resulting list will contain only modifications with the ADD and DELETE
                  modification types, which could be played in reverse to recreate the source
                  entry from the target entry, but is more likely to fail if the entry has been
                  altered in some way since attempting to apply the modifications.  If the
                  modifications should not be reversible, then they will all use the REPLACE
                  modification type, which is not reversible but more likely to succeed even if
                  the entry has been altered.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Improved the way that the LDAP SDK generates string representations of DNs and
                  RDNs.  When creating a DN from a set of RDNs (or from an RDN and parent DN), it
                  will now use the string representations of the provided RDNs (and optionally DN)
                  rather than reconstructing the entire string representation.  This can help
                  preserve a user-supplied string representation if you do something like
                  "<tt>new DN(existingDN.getRDNs())</tt>", particularly if the existing DN had
                  characters that may be escaped but don't have to be.  In addition, a new
                  <tt>toMinimallyEncodedString</tt> method has been added to both the <tt>DN</tt>
                  and <tt>RDN</tt> classes which will construct a string representation of the
                  DN or RDN with a minimal set of escaped characters (e.g., non-ASCII characters
                  and non-printible ASCII characters will not be escaped).
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Fixed a bug in the LDIF reader in which it would refuse to decode an entry
                  containing only a DN but no attributes (e.g., like might be the case with a
                  search result entry where the requested attribute set contained only "1.1").
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Fixed a bug in the way that LDAP URLs were generated for URLs containing the
                  subordinate subtree search scope.  Previously, the string representation of
                  such URLs would have a scope of "subord" instead of the correct "subordinates"
                  as specified in draft-sermersheim-ldap-subordinate-scope.  It will still accept
                  URLs containing "subord", but will no longer generate them.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Fixed a bug in the <tt>LDAPCommandLineTool</tt> class that prevented the
                  <tt>--bindPasswordFile</tt> argument from being used in conjunction with the
                  <tt>--bindDN</tt> argument.  Due to an oversight, <tt>--bindPasswordFile</tt>
                  could only be used when performing SASL authentication when no bind DN was
                  given.

              <h3>Version 1.1.1</h3>

              <p>
                The following changes were made between the 1.1.0 and 1.1.1 releases:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Updated the searchrate, modrate, and authrate tools to change the way that they
                  signal the processing threads to start.  The previous approach could lead to
                  resource starvation causing the system to run with 100% CPU utilization for a
                  period of time.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Improved the accuracy of the searchrate, modrate, and authrate tools.  The
                  overall rates were accurate, but the recent rates could be slightly off.
                  In addition, the recent and overall rates for the first interval often didn't
                  match up.  These problems have been resolved.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the searchrate and modrate tools to support the use of the proxied
                  authorization v2 control.  The authorization ID may be specified as a value
                  pattern, which makes it possible to specify a range of alternate authorization
                  identities.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added <tt>isClosed</tt> methods to the connection pool implementations which can
                  be used to determine whether the connection pool has been closed.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the value pattern implementation to provide support for reading values
                  from files.  Files should be referenced by URL, and it supports both local files
                  (using a URL like "file:///path/to/file") and remote files via HTTP (using a URL
                  like "http://server.example.com/path/to/file"), and that URL should be enclosed
                  in square brackets.  For example, a value pattern of "[file:///tmp/filters.txt]"
                  will cause the individual lines of the file "/tmp/filters.txt" to be read and
                  randomly substituted for that portion of the value pattern.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the searchrate, modrate, and authrate tools so that they provide the
                  ability to display information about the result codes for operations that don't
                  complete successfully.  If any errors are encountered during processing, then
                  the result codes for those failures will be displayed along with the number of
                  times that result was returned.  The "--suppressErrorResultCodes" argument may
                  be provided to disable this capability.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Improved the behavior exhibited by the LDAP SDK when interacting with a server
                  that is completely unresponsive (e.g., as in the case in which the network cable
                  has been removed, or the server process has been halted with a command like
                  pstop).  This includes improved support for honoring any configured connect
                  timeout, even for SSL-based connections which did not previously support it.
                  Bind and extended requests can now have an explicit timeout assigned to them,
                  like was already possible for all other types of requests.  When duplicating a
                  request, any assigned timeout is also duplicated along with the other details of
                  that request.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Improved the error message in the exception thrown if a client-side timeout
                  occurs.  The updated message now includes the type of operation and the length
                  of time the client waited before considering the operation to have timed out.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the <tt>RootDSE</tt> and <tt>Schema</tt> classes so that their
                  constructors which take <tt>Entry</tt> objects are made public, since they can
                  be useful in code outside of the LDAP SDK.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Made the <tt>SearchRequest.getSearchResultListener</tt> method public so that
                  code outside of the LDAP SDK can determine whether a search result listener has
                  been configured for the search.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the message properties files to use better format strings for messages
                  containing numbers.  Previously, large numbers could be formatted awkwardly
                  (e.g., including commas as grouping separators, like "12,345" instead of just
                  "12345").
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the LDAP SDK so that the thread-local <tt>ASN1Buffer</tt> object used for
                  connections is made static rather than per-instance.  This can dramatically
                  reduce the amount of memory consumed for applications with large numbers of
                  connections that can be used by multiple threads.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added methods that can be used to determine whether an attribute value needs to
                  be base64-encoded when represented in LDIF.  Also, updated the
                  <tt>Attribute.toString</tt> methods so that values will be base64-encoded in
                  that string representation if they should be base64-encoded in LDIF.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the LDAP SDK so that it allows working with ASN.1 elements whose values
                  are contained in a portion of a byte array rather than always requiring them to
                  be the full array.  The sequence and set parsing code now takes advantage of
                  this, and elements decoded from them no longer require allocation of new arrays
                  for holding their values.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Improved support for client-side use of matching rules.  All matching rule
                  classes now provide the ability to retrieve the name and OID of the equality,
                  ordering, and substring matching rules that they implement.  The
                  <tt>MatchingRule</tt> class now provides the ability to select a matching rule
                  instance from the OID of the desired matching rule.  The <tt>EntrySorter</tt>
                  class has been updated so that if a sort key contains a matching rule ID, then
                  it will be used to select the matching rule to use for the client-side sorting.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the schema parsing code so that when reading schema definitions from
                  LDAP or LDIF, any leading and trailing spaces will be trimmed before attempting
                  to parse the elements.  Technically, leading and trailing spaces are illegal
                  and should not be present in such definitions, but some servers are lenient and
                  allow them so the LDAP SDK should attempt to accommodate such definitions.  It
                  will still never generate schema element definitions containing leading or
                  trailing spaces.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the LDAP SDK so that any debug messages or string representations of
                  exception stack traces that it generates will include the revision number of the
                  source repository from which the LDAP SDK was built.  This can help make it
                  easier to troubleshoot problems, since it is easier to identify the version of
                  the source used to generate the LDAP SDK build being used.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Fixed a bug that can cause problems for clients operating in the default
                  asynchronous mode if the server sends response messages broken up into small
                  pieces rather than all a once.  In particular, if a response message contains
                  only the BER type, or only the BER type and a portion (but not all of) the
                  length, then the LDAP SDK may not be able to properly decode the full message if
                  there is a delay between the first and second packets with portions of the type
                  and length.  If this problem occurs, then the client would terminate the
                  connection to the server.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p></p>


              <h3>Version 1.1.0</h3>

              <p>
                The following changes were made between the 1.0.0 and 1.1.0 releases:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  A new license has been added to the UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java.  In addition
                  to the previous GNU General Public License (GPLv2) and UnboundID LDAP SDK Free
                  Use License, the Standard Edition of the LDAP SDK is now available under the
                  terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPLv2.1).  This is an
                  OSI-approved open source license which allows the SDK to be used in a very wide
                  range of applications (including proprietary and commercial applications).
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  The Standard Edition of the LDAP SDK is now available in a SourceForge project
                  at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ldap-sdk/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/ldap-sdk/</a>.
                  This includes a subversion repository containing the source code, as well as a
                  new set of project mailing lists and a forum.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  The Standard Edition of the LDAP SDK is now available for use with Maven.  It
                  is available at
                  <a href="http://ldap-sdk.sourceforge.net/maven/">http://ldap-sdk.sourceforge.net/maven/</a>
                  with a groupId of "com.unboundid", an artifactId of "unboundid-ldapsdk", and a
                  version of "1.1.0".  In the near future, it will also be included in the Central
                  Repository.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the <tt>LDAPCommandLineTool</tt> class to provide support for handling
                  connections to multiple servers.  If this capability is enabled, then it will
                  allow multiple occurrences of the "--hostname" and "--port" arguments to be
                  provided.  If multiple addresses and ports are provided, then the same number of
                  each must be given, and a RoundRobinServerSet will be used when creating
                  connections so that each subsequent connection will be established to the next
                  server in the list, looping back to the beginning of the list when all servers
                  have been used.  The searchrate, modrate, and authrate tools have been updated
                  to take advantage of this capability, so they may now be used to process
                  operations concurrently against multiple servers.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the build process so that the manifest for the generated jar file
                  contains an appropriate set of attributes to make the LDAP SDK more suitable for
                  use in an OSGi environment.  The added attributes include:  Bundle-Name,
                  Bundle-Version, Bundle-Vendor, Bundle-Copyright, Bundle-ManifestVersion,
                  Bundle-RequiredExecutionEnvironment, Bundle-Category, Bundle-DocURL, and
                  Export-Package.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the <tt>ResultCode.isConnectionUsable()</tt> method to be more
                  conservative so that it is more likely to return a false positive (i.e., the
                  connection will be considered unusable when it may still be usable) than a false
                  negative (the connection will be considered usable when it that is not the
                  case).  Also, non-static versions of the <tt>isClientSideResultCode()</tt> and
                  <tt>isConnectionUsable()</tt> methods have been added for convenience.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added <tt>finalize()</tt> methods for the connection pool implementations so
                  that the pool will be closed when it is reaped by the garbage collector if that
                  was not already done.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added support to make it easier to migrate applications written to use the
                  Netscape Directory SDK for Java to the UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java.  This
                  includes wrappers for a number of commonly-used classes in the Netscape API so
                  that in many cases it may be sufficient to simply change the import statements
                  of the application so that they reference
                  "com.unboundid.ldap.sdk.migrate.ldapjdk" instead of "netscape.ldap".  This is
                  not a complete re-implementation of the Netscape API (e.g., it does not directly
                  support applications written to use asynchronous operations), but in the common
                  case it should help significantly reduce the code change required to migrate an
                  application from the Netscape API to the UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added support to make it easier to migrate applications written to use the Java
                  Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) to the UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java, or to
                  allow applications which use functionality provided by both APIs concurrently.
                  A new JNDIConverter class has been added which provides support for converting
                  between corresponding JNDI and LDAP SDK implementations of common data
                  structures, including attributes, controls, extended requests and responses,
                  modifications, and search result entries.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added a new "use schema" LDAP connection option which can be used to cause
                  operations on the connection to make use of schema information when reading
                  data from the directory server.  In particular, the schema will be used to
                  select the appropriate matching rule for each attribute included in search
                  result entries.  The <tt>Attribute</tt> class has been updated to provide new
                  constructors which take <tt>Schema</tt> objects that allow that schema to be
                  used to select the appropriate matching rule for that attribute.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added a set of <tt>Attribute.nameIsValid</tt> methods which can be used to
                  determine whether a provided string is a valid attribute name.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added additional <tt>Attribute.hasValue</tt> and
                  <tt>Entry.hasAttributeValue</tt> methods which allow an alternate matching rule
                  to be provided which will be used when making the determination rather than the
                  matching rule with which that attribute type is associated.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added support for the case-ignore list equality and substring matching rules,
                  as used by the postal address syntax.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the searchrate, modrate, and authrate tools to include new command-line
                  options.  The "<tt>--timestampFormat</tt>" argument may be used to indicate
                  whether timestamps should be included in the output, and if so what format
                  should be used (either the time only or both the date and the time).  The
                  "<tt>--warmUpIntervals</tt>" argument may be used to indicate that the tool
                  should be allowed to run for a specified number of intervals before beginning
                  overall statistics collection to allow the client and the server to warm up.

              </ul>

              <p></p>


              <h3>Version 1.0.0</h3>

              <p>
                The following changes were made between the 0.9.10 and 1.0.0 releases:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Updated the code used to read server responses so that it uses a result code of
                  "server down" rather than "protocol error" whenever an I/O error occurs while
                  reading the response.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added support for the permissive modify control, which may be used to request
                  that the directory server accept modify requests which attempt to add an
                  attribute value that already exists in the target entry, or to remove an
                  attribute value which does not exist in the target entry.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the code used to parse schema elements to be more lenient and
                  standards-compliant when handling optional spaces in definitions.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added a new <tt>LDAPThreadLocalConnectionPool</tt> class, which is very similar
                  to the existing <tt>LDAPConnectionPool</tt> class, except that it uses a
                  thread-local mechanism to maintain a separate connection for each client thread
                  that attempts to communicate with the server.  This can help eliminate some
                  thread contention, and can help avoid the need to define an explicit size for
                  the pool, since it will have as many connections as threads attempting to use
                  the pool.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added the ability to create a <tt>Schema</tt> object by reading schema
                  definitions from one or more LDIF files.  It was previously only possible to
                  read schema information from a directory server over LDAP.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the LDIF reader to provide the ability to reject entries containing
                  duplicate values for the same attribute.  Previously, if an entry had multiple
                  occurrences of the same value for the same attribute, the LDIF reader would
                  simply silently ignore the duplicate values.  This is still the default
                  behavior, but it is now possible to configure the LDIF reader to reject
                  entries with duplicate attribute values.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the LDIF reader to provide the ability to use schema information when
                  reading entries and change records.  This can be used to help better handle
                  treatment of different values which might have otherwise been considered
                  duplicates using the default case-ignore string matching rule (e.g., attributes
                  that should use case-exact matching and have values that differ only in
                  capitalization).
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the validate-ldif tool provided with the LDAP SDK so that it offers the
                  ability to use schema definitions read from files rather than over LDAP (so that
                  it can be used in a completely offline manner).  It will also now reject entries
                  with duplicate attribute values by default, but provides an option to ignore such
                  errors.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the <tt>EntryValidator</tt> class so that it properly handles entries
                  with the <tt>extensibleObject</tt> object class.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Fixed a bug that could prevent LDAP connection statistics from being updated for
                  asynchronous search operations.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added convenience methods to the <tt>Attribute</tt> and <tt>Entry</tt> classes
                  which may be used to retrieve attribute values as DNs.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added convenience methods to the <tt>DN</tt> and <tt>Entry</tt> classes which
                  may be used to determine whether a given DN or entry is within the range of a
                  specified search base and scope.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p></p>


              <h3>Version 0.9.10</h3>

              <p>
                The following changes were made between the 0.9.9 and 0.9.10 releases:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Updated the schema parsing code so that schema elements will be held in ordered
                  maps so that they can be accessed in the order they were returned by the server.
                  This can help ensure that order-based dependencies (e.g., an object class which
                  inherits from a superior class) may be properly maintained if they are returned
                  from the server in that order.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Fixed a bug in the schema parsing code that incorrectly selected a generalized
                  time matching rule when it should have chosen an integer matching rule.  This
                  could cause the validate-ldif tool to incorrectly report syntax violations for
                  data using an integer syntax, along with other failures for code relying on this
                  capability in the LDAP SDK.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the LDAP SDK to add an option to operate in synchronous mode.  For
                  connections which do not need to invoke asynchronous operations and which will
                  not be used concurrently by multiple threads, then the application can use the
                  <tt>LDAPConnectionOptions.setUseSynchronousMode(true)</tt> method to enable
                  synchronous mode for the connection options before connecting to the directory
                  server.  When in this mode, responses will be read by the same thread which sent
                  the request, rather than by a separate reader thread.  This can significantly
                  improve performance when communicating with the server.
                  <br><br>
                  Other performance improvements have also been made in the LDAP SDK which may
                  benefit both the default asynchronous mode as well as the new synchronous
                  mode.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Fixed a bug that could cause intermittent failures with a "server down" result
                  in which the connection was terminated.  The problem would be triggered if the
                  client could not read an entire LDAP message at once and there was a significant
                  delay of greater than 50 milliseconds when attempting to read additional data as
                  part of the message.  This could cause the SDK to attempt to read the middle of
                  an LDAP message as if it were the beginning, which would cause a decoding
                  failure that would trigger the SDK to terminate the connection.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Fixed a bug in the ObjectClassDefinition class that caused it to ignore the
                  recursive argument.  Previously, it would always recursively get all superior
                  classes even if the recursive argument was set to false.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Fixed a bug that prevented entries returned by automatically following a
                  referral from being included in the search result entry count.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the LDAPSearch example tool to include an option for following referrals
                  encountered during processing.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p></p>


              <h3>Version 0.9.9</h3>

              <p>
                The following changes were made between the 0.9.8 and 0.9.9 releases:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Updated the javadoc documentation to make the EntrySource API (and in particular
                  the LDAPEntrySource class) more visible.  References to LDAPEntrySource are now
                  present in the class-level documentation for the SearchRequest class and
                  SearchResultListener interface.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Created a new SearchResultReferenceEntrySourceException as a subclass of
                  EntrySourceException that will be thrown if a search result reference is returned
                  when using the LDAPEntrySource class.  This makes it easier to access the
                  contents of any search result references returned through this API.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added LDAPException.hasControl methods that mirror the LDAPResult.hasControl
                  methods and provide additional convenience when working with controls in results
                  for operations that returned with a non-successful result.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Placed a maximum size on the blocking queue used to hold search result entries
                  and references while waiting for them to be processed.  This can help prevent
                  problems in which a client could be potentially overwhelmed or required to use a
                  lot of memory for a search that returns a large number of entries when a search
                  result listener is used and the client cannot process entries as quickly as they
                  are returned.  If the queue becomes full, then the LDAP SDK will push back
                  against the directory server so that it will only be able to send entries as
                  fast as the client can consume them.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added the ability to control automatic referral following at a per-request level.
                  By default, the LDAP SDK will still use the behavior defined at the connection
                  level, but it is now possible to override that on a per-request level if desired.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added the ability to include a call stack trace in debug log messages.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the LDAP connection pool implementation to ensure that the auto-reconnect
                  connection option is ignored for connections which are part of a connection pool.
                  In some cases, the use of this option for pooled connections could cause
                  connections to be re-established when the pool had attempted to close them.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added the ability to assign user-friendly names to connections and connection
                  pools.  This can be helpful in applications which maintain multiple connections
                  or connection pools for different purposes.  The name of the connection or
                  connection pool can be queried via code and will also appear in the names of the
                  threads used to read responses from the directory server for those connections so
                  that they will be more visible in thread stack traces.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Fixed a bug in the LDIF writer that could cause an extra space to be added to the
                  beginning of the last line of a multi-line comment.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated LDAP connection pool implementations so that releasing a defunct
                  connection will not automatically cause a new connection to be created to replace
                  it if the pool already has the maximum number of available connections.
                  Previously, the connection pool could have created and then immediately closed
                  a connection in that scenario.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added additional connection pool statistics that can be used to help distinguish
                  between differences in behavior when a connection was successfully checked out of
                  the pool.  It is now possible to differentiate between cases in which an
                  existing connection was returned without any wait, an existing connection was
                  returned after waiting for it to become available, or a new connection was
                  created to return to the client.  This can help make information available for
                  applications to understand whether their connection pools are sized
                  appropriately.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the LDAP SDK to change the manner in which a connection is closed if it
                  is done by the Java finalizer (which would presumably only occur if a connection
                  was leaked by the application using it).  If the connection is part of a
                  connection pool, then it will now simply be terminated rather than released back
                  to the pool as a defunct connection.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Made the LDAPRequest.getLastMessageID() method public.  This was previously used
                  internally, but may be useful when trying to cancel a synchronous request from a
                  different thread.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added the ability to control the send and receive buffer sizes for sockets used
                  when communicating with the directory server.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the LDAP SDK to provide better information to clients in the event that a
                  connection is terminated because of an unrecoverable error encountered while
                  reading responses from the directory server.  This information was previously
                  only available through the debugging framework, but the LDAP SDK will now attempt
                  to generate a response to provide to the client with information about the
                  failure so that it will be available when debugging isn't enabled.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added a static Attribute.getBaseName(String) method that may be used to retrieve
                  the base name without any attribute options for a specified attribute
                  description.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the format of LDAP SDK debug messages to make them more consistent and
                  easier to parse.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added the ability to capture a thread stack trace at the time that an attempt is
                  made to establish a connection.  This can be useful for debugging purposes,
                  especially for tracking down the source of a leaked connection.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added the ability to update an Entry object with one or more modifications.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Fixed a bug that could prevent the LDAP SDK from correctly following referrals
                  for search operations.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p></p>

              <h3>Version 0.9.8</h3>

              <p>
                The following changes were made between the 0.9.7 and 0.9.8 releases:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Fixed a bug that could prevent the LDAP SDK from returning a response to the
                  StartTLS extended request if the server certificate was not trusted.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Fixed a bug that could cause the connection pool implementation to leak a
                  connection when performing a background health check if that connection was
                  examined multiple times in the same health check sequence.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Fixed a bug in the <tt>LDAPConnectionPool.getRootDSE()</tt> method in which it
                  could inadvertently check out two connections when only one was required.  Both
                  connections were properly returned to the pool, but holding the unnecessary
                  connection could create an artificial shortage of available connections.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Fixed a problem that caused the name of the background thread used by the
                  internal <tt>LDAPConnectionReader</tt> class to be set to "Connection reader for
                  LDAPConnection(not connected)" even when the connection was established.  This
                  has been changed so that it will be "Connection reader for {host}:{port}" when
                  the connection is established, and "Connection reader for {host}:{port} (closed)"
                  when the connection has been closed.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added a new <tt>com.unboundid.util.FixedRateBarrier</tt> class which can be used
                  to help try to perform operations no faster than a specified rate.  The authrate,
                  modrate, and searchrate tools have been updated to include a new
                  "<tt>--ratePerSecond</tt>" argument that can be used to attempt to process
                  authentications, modifies, and searches at the specified rate.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the <tt>CompareRequest</tt> class to make the
                  <tt>setAssertionValue(ASN1OctetString)</tt> method public, since it can be useful
                  in code outside of the LDAP SDK itself.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added an <tt>Attribute.getMatchingRule()</tt> method that can be used to get the
                  matching rule that will be used by default for matching operations involving that
                  attribute.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added the ability to easily convert between <tt>Filter</tt> objects (which are
                  normal search filters) and <tt>MatchedValuesFilter</tt> objects (which are used
                  in the matched values request control).  Not all search filters are valid matched
                  values filters, so an attempt to convert a search filter using an AND, OR, or NOT
                  component, or using an extensible match component with the "dnAttributes" flag
                  set will throw an exception.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Message strings used by the LDAP SDK have been updated so that they use single
                  quotes rather than double quotes.  If the messages generated by the LDAP SDK
                  (especially those included in exceptions) are consumed by and embedded in
                  messages from another application, then single quotes are less likely to create
                  confusion or need escaping if anything tries to parse those messages.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the output of the authrate, modrate, and searchrate tools so that a row
                  of dashes is displayed between the column headings and the data, which moderately
                  improves the appearance.  This will not be used when CSV-formatted output is
                  requested.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p></p>

              <h3>Version 0.9.7</h3>

              <p>
                The following changes were made between the 0.9.6 and 0.9.7 releases:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Further improved the performance of the LDIFReader for entries containing
                  multi-valued attributes.  The change introduced the 0.9.6 version was only
                  applicable for entries with an LDIF representation of at least 100 lines.  The
                  new implementation works for entries of any size and can help dramatically
                  improve read performance for smaller static groups, whereas the previous change
                  only worked for large groups.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added a new <tt>com.unboundid.ldap.sdk.CompactEntry</tt> class that provides much
                  of the same functionality of the <tt>Entry</tt> class but in a manner that
                  requires much less memory.  This is particularly useful for cases in which it may
                  be necessary to store a large number of entries in memory.  For one test
                  involving typical user entries, CompactEntry has been found to require only about
                  25% as much memory as Entry.  For another test involving static groups with 20
                  members each, CompactEntry has been found to require only about 31% as much
                  memory as Entry.
                  <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  Note that some operations involving CompactEntry may not perform as well as with
                  the corresponding methods in the Entry class, so it is generally recommended that
                  CompactEntry only be used when it is necessary to store a large number of entries
                  in memory.  Further, CompactEntry objects are read-only and the API does not
                  expose any way to directly alter their contents.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Fixed a potential null pointer exception that could arise as a result of a race
                  condition when closing a connection.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Made a minor change to the <tt>com.unboundid.ldif.LDIFChangeRecord</tt> class so
                  that the <tt>processChange</tt> method now takes an <tt>LDAPInterface</tt>
                  argument rather than an <tt>LDAPConnection</tt>.  This change is completely
                  backward compatible, since <tt>LDAPConnection</tt> implements
                  <tt>LDAPInterface</tt>, but the new version makes it more convenient to use with
                  connection pools.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added source code for a simple application that allows the UnboundID LDAP SDK for
                  Java to be used to communicate with an LDAP directory server on Android mobile
                  devices.  This application makes it possible to perform searches against an LDAP
                  directory server, and can parse user entries to make it possible to call or
                  e-mail a user found in the directory, show a map of their location, or add
                  information about that user to the device's local contacts.  More information
                  about this application can be found at
                  <a href="http://directorymanager.wordpress.com/2009/03/24/using-ldap-on-android/">http://directorymanager.wordpress.com/2009/03/24/using-ldap-on-android/</a>,
                  including a video demonstrating its use.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Version 0.9.6</h3>

              <p>
                The following changes were made between the 0.9.5 and 0.9.6 releases:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Added support for the LDAP intermediate response protocol op type as described in
                  RFC 3771.  Intermediate responses provide the ability for operations to return
                  multiple responses to a single request.  A new
                  <tt>IntermediateResponseListener</tt> interface has been added, and clients can
                  use the <tt>LDAPRequest.setIntermediateResponseListener</tt> method to indicate
                  that any intermediate response messages returned in response to that request
                  should be made available via that interface.  If no intermediate response
                  listener is defined for a request, then any intermediate response messages
                  returned in response to that request will be silently discarded (although a debug
                  message will be generated).
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Fixed a problem in the <tt>LDIFReader</tt> class in which it did not properly
                  propagate the <tt>LDIFException</tt> that was thrown if the first line of an
                  LDIF record started with a space.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Fixed a potential problem in the searchrate and modrate tools in which the
                  auto-reconnect flag did not get properly set on the connections that they used.
                  Before this fix, if the connection to the server was lost for some reason, then
                  they would not make any attempt to re-establish the connection.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added a new authrate tool as an example.  It can be used to measure
                  authentication performance, where each authentication consists of a search to
                  retrieve a user entry followed by a bind to verify the password for that user.
                  It supports simple authentication, as well as the CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5, and PLAIN
                  SASL mechanisms.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the <tt>CommandLineTool</tt> API to make it possible to include example
                  usages for tools that will be included whenever the usage information is
                  displayed.  This can make it easier to understand how a given tool might be used.
                  The example tools provided with the LDAP SDK have been updated to provide this
                  capability.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated LDAP connection pools to provide support for a maximum connection age.
                  If a maximum connection age is defined, then any connection which has been
                  established for a longer period than this will be closed and replaced with a new
                  connection.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Created a new <tt>LDAPConnectionStatistics</tt> class that can be used to provide
                  information about the processing performed by the LDAP SDK.  The connection
                  statistics can be retrieved using the
                  <tt>LDAPConnection.getConnectionStatistics</tt> method, and they include
                  information about the number of times the connection has been established and
                  closed, the number of times each type of request message has been sent, the
                  number of times each type of response message has been received, and the total
                  and average response times for those operations.  This feature was suggested by
                  Philip Peake.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Created a new <tt>LDAPConnectionPoolStatistics</tt> class that can be used to
                  provide information about the processing performed by the connection pool.  The
                  connection pool statistics can be retrieved using the
                  <tt>LDAPConnectionPool.getConnectionPoolStatistics()</tt> method, and they
                  include the number of connections currently available in the pool, the maximum
                  number of connections that may be maintained in the pool, the number of
                  successful and failed attempts to create connections, the number of connections
                  that have been closed as defunct, expired, or unneeded, the number of successful
                  and failed attempts to retrieve a connection, and the number of valid connections
                  released back to the pool.  This feature was suggested by Philip Peake.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated LDAP connection pools to provide support for connection health checking.
                  Health check implementations may be used to perform custom checks to determine
                  whether a connection is valid at any of the following times:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Whenever a new connection is created for use in the pool</li>
                    <li>Whenever a connection is checked out of the pool</li>
                    <li>Whenever a connection is released back to the pool</li>
                    <li>After an exception has been caught while processing an operation in the
                        pool</li>
                  </ul>
                  In addition, a background thread will be used to periodically invoke health
                  checks against all available connections.  The <tt>ServerSet</tt> API has been
                  updated to provide the ability to make use of a health check in the course of
                  creating new connections.  A health check implementation has been provided that
                  can be used to retrieve a specified entry from the directory server.  The ability
                  or inability to retrieve the entry, as well as the time required to do so, can be
                  taken into consideration.  This feature was suggested by Philip Peake.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added a number of convenience methods to the DN and RDN class that make it easier
                  to interact with them using their string representations.  For example, there are
                  now methods for determining if a string represents a valid DN or RDN, if two
                  strings represent the same DN or RDN, to determine whether there is a
                  hierarchical relationship between two strings representing DNs, and to compare
                  two DNs or RDNs based on their string representations.  This feature was
                  suggested by Felix Gaehtgens.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the LDIF reader to significantly improve performance when reading entries
                  containing attributes with a large number of values (e.g., large static groups).
                  In a single-threaded test case involving reading static group entries with 2000
                  members each, performance has been improved by over 360x (i.e., over 36,000%).
                  This problem was reported by Felix Gaehtgens.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p></p>

              <h3>Version 0.9.5</h3>

              <p>
                This was the initial public release of the UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java.
