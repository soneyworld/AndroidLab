              <h2>Ease of Use</h2>

              <p>
                The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java was specifically designed to be very user-friendly.
                We have a great deal of experience working with real-world directory environments
                and writing directory-enabled applications, and as a result we are well aware of
                the challenges and frustrations that may be encountered when working with other
                LDAP SDKs.
              </p>

              <p>
                The primary reason that JNDI is commonly-used for directory-enabled applications is
                that it is part of the core Java platform.  In fact, that is perhaps the only
                reason for its popularity, since the API itself is absolutely horrible.  It is very
                abstract (in fact, it is intended for use in communicating with a number of
                different types of systems, so it really isn't an LDAP API as much as an API that
                happens to provide LDAP support), which means that performing simple tasks often
                require significantly more code than should be required, and that it uses
                terminology that can be extremely confusing (e.g., in JNDI, the "bind" method is
                used to add an entry to the directory rather than performing an LDAP bind
                operation).  Further, the abstract nature of the API may make some tasks either
                difficult (e.g., performing an LDAP compare operation) or impossible (e.g.,
                retrieving the result code from an operation).  Finally, JNDI provides virtually no
                support for anything but the most basic functionality.  It provides no facilities
                for interacting with data in LDIF form, or for performing ASN.1 encoding/decoding
                needed to support development of custom controls and extensions.
              </p>

              <p>
                The Netscape Directory SDK for Java is LDAP-centric and therefore much more
                user-friendly than JNDI.  It doesn't suffer from the terminology conflicts that
                plagues JNDI, and it does offer support for additional functionality like parsing
                the server schema, LDIF processing, ASN.1 processing, and base64 processing.  The
                primary concerns related to ease of use of the Netscape Directory SDK for Java
                aren't really issues of tasks being difficult to perform but rather that many
                common tasks are not as convenient as they could be.
              </p>

              <p>
                The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java is rather similar to the Netscape Directory SDK
                for Java, and developers familiar with the Netscape SDK should find it easy to
                switch to the UnboundID offering.  However, many kinds of tasks can be performed
                in the UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java more conveniently and with less effort.
              </p>

              <p>
                Perhaps the best way to illustrate the relative ease of use of these APIs is by
                providing a few examples.  The rest of this page will demonstrate the code required
                to perform common tasks in JNDI, the Netscape Directory SDK for Java, and the
                UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java.  For the sake of simplicity, exception handling has been
                omitted from all examples.

              <h3>Establishing a Connection</h3>

              <p>
                This section will demonstrate the process for establishing a simple LDAPv3
                connection (with no SSL or other security) and performing a simple bind operation.
              </p>

              <p></p>
              <b>JNDI</b>

              <p>
                In JNDI, when you wish to establish a connection to an LDAP directory server, you
                should create an <tt>InitialLdapContext</tt> object.  This can be quite a daunting
                task, because the only way that you have to specify the target server, whether or
                not to use SSL or some other security mechanism, whether or not to authenticate,
                etc. is by providing a set of properties.  There aren't any convenience methods to
                help you figure out what those properties might be (although there are constants in
                some cases), so you have to look through the documentation to try to find them, and
                in fact some of these properties and/or values use "com.sun.*" prefixes, so it
                isn't even clear whether they are safe to use in code that might run on Java
                implementations provided by vendors other than Sun.
              </p>

              <p>
                Here is an example of the work required to do this in JNDI:
              </p>

              <pre>
Properties env = new Properties();
env.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, "com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory");
env.put(Context.PROVIDER_URL, "ldap://server.example.com:389/");
env.put(Context.SECURITY_PRINCIPAL,
        "uid=test.user,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com");
env.put(Context.SECURITY_CREDENTIALS, "password");
env.put("java.naming.ldap.version", "3");

LdapContext connection = new InitialLdapContext(env, null);
</pre>

              <p></p>
              <b>Netscape Directory SDK for Java</b>

              <p>
                The Netscape Directory SDK for Java is significantly simpler to use than JNDI
                because there is no need to worry about figuring out what properties need to be
                set.  The following example demonstrates the work required to create an
                authenticated connection using the Netscape Directory SDK for Java:
              </p>

              <pre>
LDAPConnection connection = new LDAPConnection();
connection.connect(3, "server.example.com", 389,
                   "uid=test.user,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com", "password");
</pre>

              <p>
                Note the inclusion of the "3" as the first argument to the <tt>connect</tt> method.
                This is very important (although unfortunately very easy to overlook, since there
                is also a version of the <tt>connect</tt> method without the version but with all
                of the other arguments) because by default the Netscape Directory SDK for Java
                uses LDAPv2 and you must override that if you want to use LDAPv3.  Otherwise, you
                may find strange behavior in your application (e.g., not getting response controls
                when you expect them, or not being able to use extended operations, since LDAPv2
                doesn't support them).
              </p>

              <p></p>
              <b>UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java</b>

              <p>
                The process for establishing a connection using simple authentication in the
                UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java is similar to the process for performing the same
                operation in the Netscape Directory SDK for Java, but it also provides the
                ability to establish the connection and perform simple authentication in the
                constructor so it is not necessary to perform as two separate steps (although you
                can separate them if you wish to do so, e.g., to be able to get response controls
                from the bind operation).  Further, there is no need to explicitly request LDAPv3,
                since the UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java uses LDAPv3 by default.
              </p>

              <pre>
LDAPConnection connection = new LDAPConnection("server.example.com", 389,
     "uid=test.user,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com", "password");
</pre>

              <p></p>
              <h3>Performing a Search Operation</h3>

              <p>
                This section will demonstrate the process for performing a search to find a user
                entry and then retrieve that user's e-mail address from the <tt>mail</tt>
                attribute.  In each of these cases, it will be assumed that only one entry will be
                returned, so we don't need to worry about the possibility of multiple entries
                matching the search criteria.
              </p>

              <p></p>
              <b>JNDI</b>

              <p>
                The JNDI "<tt>search</tt>" methods may be used to perform searches in the
                directory, and the simplest of these in most cases is the variant that takes string
                representations of the base DN and filter and a <tt>SearchControls</tt> object.
                This is another case where JNDI suffers from a poor choice of terminology because
                "controls" in this case does not have anything at all to do with LDAP controls but
                rather with a set of miscellaneous options used to perform the search (e.g., the
                search scope, attributes to return, size and time limits, etc.).
              </p>

              <p>
                Something else that directory developers may find confusing is that the methods
                used to get attribute values have a generic return type of <tt>Object</tt>.  It is
                not clear from the JNDI specification whether these objects will always be strings
                or whether they may be other types of objects.  Further, it is not necessarily
                clear if it is possible to obtain the values in any other form (e.g., the raw bytes
                that make up the value).
              </p>

              <p>
                The following code illustrates the process for performing the desired search
                processing in JNDI:
              </p>

              <pre>
SearchControls searchControls = new SearchControls();
searchControls.setSearchScope(SearchControls.SUBTREE_SCOPE);
searchControls.setReturningAttributes(new String[] { "mail" });

String mail = null;
NamingEnumeration&lt;SearchResult&gt; results =
     connection.search("dc=example,dc=com", "(uid=john.doe)", searchControls);
while (results.hasMore())
{
  SearchResult result = results.next();
  Attributes attributes = result.getAttributes();
  Attribute attribute = attributes.get("mail");
  if (attribute != null)
  {
    Object o = attribute.get();
    if (o != null)
    {
      mail = String.valueOf(o);
    }
  }
}
</pre>

              <p></p>
              <b>Netscape Directory SDK for Java</b>

              <p>
                Performing this search using the Netscape Directory SDK requires slightly less
                code than the JNDI version, and again is significantly less confusing.  The
                Netscape Directory SDK provides the ability to get attribute values as either
                strings or byte arrays.  The process for achieving the desired result, however,
                is still not as convenient as it could be, and a significant problem that may
                arise is that the <tt>LDAPSearchResults.next()</tt> method may throw an exception
                even if the search is not yet complete (e.g., if the server returns a search
                result reference while there are still more entries to be returned, and the SDK
                has not been configured to follow referrals, which it is not by default), so just
                because an exception is thrown doesn't mean that search processing is over.
              </p>

              <p>
                The following code illustrates the process for performing the desired search
                processing using the Netscape Directory SDK for Java.  Note that for simplicity,
                this code does not attempt to address the above concern over throwing an exception
                when there are still more results to return.
              </p>

              <pre>
LDAPSearchResults searchResults =
     connection.search("dc=example,dc=com", LDAPConnection.SCOPE_SUB,
                       "(uid=john.doe)", new String[] { "mail" }, false);

String mail = null;
while (searchResults.hasMoreElements())
{
  LDAPEntry entry = searchResults.next();
  LDAPAttribute attribute = entry.getAttribute("mail");
  if (attribute != null)
  {
    String[] values = attribute.getStringValueArray();
    if ((values != null) &amp;&amp; (values.length &gt; 0))
    {
      mail = values[0];
    }
  }
}
</pre>

              <p></p>
              <b>UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java</b>

              <p>
                The following code may be used to perform the same task in the UnboundID LDAP SDK
                for Java:
              </p>

              <pre>
SearchResult searchResults = connection.search("dc=example,dc=com",
                                  SearchScope.SUB, "(uid=john.doe)", "mail");

String mail = null;
if (searchResults.getEntryCount() &gt; 0)
{
  SearchResultEntry entry = searchResults.getSearchEntries().get(0);
  mail = entry.getAttributeValue("mail");
}
</pre>

              <p>
                In this case, you can see that the code is much more streamlined and significantly
                fewer steps are required to achieve the desired result.  You can also see a number
                of other benefits that the UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java provides:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  In the above search request, the set of requested attributes to return can be
                  specified using varargs (i.e., "<tt>String...</tt>" rather than
                  "<tt>String[]</tt>") so it is not necessary to construct an array to hold the set
                  of requested attributes (although you can still do so if you want to, since Java
                  will allow you to provide a single <tt>String[]</tt> object instead of individual
                  <tt>String</tt> objects).
                </li>
                <li>
                  The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java counts the number of matching entries for you, so
                  you don't have to do that for yourself.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java provides the ability to capture all search result
                  entries and references and include them as <tt>List</tt>s in the
                  <tt>SearchResult</tt> object.  For cases in which the expected set of matching
                  entries is small, this can be very convenient.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java makes matching entries available as
                  <tt>SearchResultEntry</tt> objects rather than as plain <tt>Entry</tt> objects.
                  <tt>SearchResultEntry</tt> objects are a subclass of <tt>Entry</tt> that may also
                  include controls.  This makes it much more convenient (and threadsafe) to access
                  the set of controls included with each entry.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The <tt>Entry</tt> class provides methods for getting direct access to attribute
                  values rather than first requiring you to retrieve the specified attribute,
                  checking to ensure that it isn't null, and then getting the associated value.
                  It also provides the ability to retrieve a single value or an array of values,
                  unlike the Netscape Directory SDK for Java which always requires that you treat
                  the values as arrays.
                </li>

              <p>
                This section will demonstrate the process for adding a simple entry to the server.
                In this case, the entry added will have the following LDIF representation:

              <pre>

              <b>JNDI</b>

              <p>
                As noted above, JNDI uses the poorly-named "bind" method to add an entry to the
                server (and "unbind" to delete an entry).  The basic reasoning for this is that it
                is trying to associate the provided set of data (the attributes) with a name (the
                DN), but this can be very confusing and frustrating for developers familiar with
                LDAP directories but not very familiar with JNDI because obviously the terms "bind"
                and "unbind" have very different meanings in LDAP.  Another nit with JNDI is that
                <tt>Attributes</tt> and <tt>Attribute</tt> are interfaces rather than classes, so
                it is necessary to create <tt>BasicAttributes</tt> and <tt>BasicAttribute</tt>
                objects instead, and it appears that there is no way to create an attribute with
                multiple values so it is first necessary to create a <tt>BasicAttribute</tt> with a
                single value and then add additional values to it.
              </p>

              <p>
                The code to use to add an entry in JNDI is as follows:
              </p>

              <pre>
Attributes attributes = new BasicAttributes();

Attribute objectClassAttribute = new BasicAttribute("objectClass", "top");
objectClassAttribute.add("domain");
attributes.put(objectClassAttribute);

attributes.put("dc", "example");

connection.bind("dc=example,dc=com", null, attributes);

              <p>
                The Netscape Directory SDK for Java uses the more appropriately-named <tt>add</tt>
                method to add entries to a directory server.  <tt>LDAPAttribute</tt> objects to
                include in the entries can be directly instantiated, and they can be created with
                multiple values.  However, it is still a little frustrating that it is necessary
                to create an <tt>LDAPEntry</tt> object in order to perform an add, and that when
                creating an entry it is necessary to use an <tt>LDAPAttributeSet</tt> instead of
                being able to use a more generic array or collection of <tt>LDAPAttribute</tt>
                objects.
              </p>

              <p>
                The code used to perform the add operation in the Netscape Directory SDK for Java
                is as follows:
              <p>

              <pre>
LDAPAttributeSet attributeSet = new LDAPAttributeSet();
attributeSet.add(
     new LDAPAttribute("objectClass", new String[] { "top", "domain" }));
attributeSet.add(new LDAPAttribute("dc", "example"));

LDAPEntry entry = new LDAPEntry("dc=example,dc=com", attributeSet);
connection.add(entry);
</pre>

              <p></p>
              <b>UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java</b>

              <p>
                The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java also uses the "<tt>add</tt>" method to add entries.
                However, as you can see this is another case in which the process is significantly
                more streamlined than either JNDI or the Netscape SDK:
              </p>

              <pre>
LDAPResult addResult = connection.add("dc=example,dc=com",
     new Attribute("objectClass", "top", "domain"),
     new Attribute("dc", "example"));
</pre>

              <p>
                It isn't necessary to create an entry in this case, since one of the available
                <tt>add</tt> methods supports providing a DN and a variable-length set of
                attributes using varargs.  Further, the fact that the set of attribute values can
                be specified using varargs means that you don't have to explicitly create an array
                in order to create a multivalued attribute.
              </p>

              <p>
                Note, however, that the UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java has another trick up its sleeve
                in that it supports adding an entry using its LDIF representation.  If you know
                exactly what the entry you want to create looks like, then you can use the
                following code to add it:
              </p>

              <pre>
LDAPResult addResult = connection.add(
     "dn: dc=example,dc=com",
     "objectClass: top",
     "objectClass: domain",
     "dc: example");
</pre>

              <p>
                The <tt>modify</tt> operation also provides the ability to modify existing entries
                using the LDIF representation, like:
              </p>

              <pre>
LDAPResult modifyResult = connection.modify(
     "dn: dc=example,dc=com",
     "changetype: modify",
     "replace: description",
     "description: Example");
</pre>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
