              <h2>Improved Security Functionality</h2>

              <p>
                Directory Servers are commonly used to store sensitive information and are used to
                perform sensitive operations like authentication and authorization.  As a result,
                it is very important to ensure that clients can communicate security with the
                server and can ensure that the requests generated are exactly what they are
                intended to be.
              </p>

              <p></p>
              <h3>Secure Communication</h3>

              <p>
                Secure communication in LDAP is generally accomplished through SSL or StartTLS.
                JNDI, the Netscape Directory SDK for Java, and the UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java all
                support communication using SSL, but the Netscape SDK does not provide any support
                for StartTLS.
              </p>

              <p>
                The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java also provides a mechanism to help simplify
                communication over SSL/TLS.  Unfortunately, Java has traditionally made SSL/TLS
                communication more complex than it needs to be, but the included
                <TT>com.unboundid.util.ssl</TT> package provides a number of classes to make this
                easier.  The SSLUtil class can be used to easily create <TT>SSLSocketFactory</TT>
                and <TT>SSLContext</TT> objects, and a number of key manager and trust manager
                implementations make it possible to control how client certificates are selected
                and whether server certificates are trusted.
              </p>

              <p></p>
              <h3>Authentication and Authorization</h3>

              <p>
                The LDAP protocol specification includes an unfortunate quirk which has been
                responsible for a number of significant client-side security problems in the past.
                It states that servers should treat simple bind operations that contain a bind DN
                but a zero-length password should be treated as anonymous binds.  If the server
                receives such a request, then it will return a SUCCESS result, which may lead the
                client to believe that the authentication was performed as the user specified as
                the bind DN.  This can lead to cases in which the client inappropriately allows a
                user to access sensitive information.  To help address this problem, the UnboundID
                LDAP SDK for Java will not allow these kinds of bind operations by default.  There
                is virtually no reason to allow them in the first place, and they are almost always
                attempts by malicious users to subvert the security of the directory-enabled
                application.  This behavior can be disabled if the client has a legitimate reason
                to perform binds with a DN but no password, but such instances will likely be
                extremely rare.
              </p>

              <p>
                When the client does authenticate to the server, it may be desirable to ensure that
                authorization identity used for the client connection is what the client expects it
                to be.  LDAP offers two standard extensions that can be used to make this
                determination.  The first is the authorization identity request control (as defined
                in RFC 3829), which indicates that the server should include the authorization
                identity in the bind response.  The second is the "Who Am I?" extended operation
                (as defined in RFC 4532), which can be used to obtain the authorization identity at
                any time after the bind is complete.  The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java supports both
                of these options.  Neither JNDI nor the Netscape Directory SDK for Java support
                either one.
              </p>

              <p>
                It is also important to ensure that operations are processed with the appropriate
                authorization identity in the server.  It is often infeasible and undesirable to
                maintain a separate connection for each user currently accessing the application,
                or to store the credentials and rebind to the server before processing each
                operation.  For that reason, is is often preferable to use the proxied
                authorization control to request that the operation be processed under the
                authority the appropriate end user.  The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java supports both
                versions of the proxied authorization control.  The Netscape Directory SDK
                supports only the proxied authorization V1 control but not V2.  JNDI does not
                support either version of this control.
              </p>

              <p>
                While the vast majority of clients perform simple authentication (which uses a bind
                DN and password), LDAP also allows the use of the Simple Authentication and
                Security Layer (SASL, as defined in RFC 4422).  This can allow for authentication
                using alternate forms of credentials and enhanced functionality.  The most
                commonly-used SASL mechanisms for LDAP clients include:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>ANONYMOUS</b> -- This is basically the equivalent of establishing an
                  unauthenticated session, with the slight added benefit of providing a trace
                  string that may appear in the server log.  The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java
                  provides support for this mechanism, but neither JNDI nor the Netscape Directory
                  SDK for Java support it.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>CRAM-MD5</b> -- This is a mechanism that can allow password-based
                  authentication over an otherwise insecure channel in a manner that will not
                  expose the password (although it does require that the server have access to the
                  clear-text password).  It is similar to DIGEST-MD5 but is slightly weaker and has
                  fewer features.  The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java provides support for this
                  mechanism.  The Netscape Directory SDK for Java does not.  JNDI can use it
                  through the Java SASL framework, although this is significantly more complex
                  than the API exposed by the UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>DIGEST-MD5</b> -- This is a mechanism that can allow password-based
                  authentication over an otherwise insecure channel in a manner that will not
                  expose the password (although it does require that the server have access to the
                  clear-text password).  It is similar to CRAM-MD5 but uses a more secure algorithm
                  and offers additional functionality.  The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java provides
                  support for this mechanism.  The Netscape Directory SDK for Java does not.  JNDI
                  can use it through the Java SASL framework, although this is significantly more
                  complex than the API exposed by the UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>EXTERNAL</b> -- This is a mechanism that can be used to perform authentication
                  based on information that the server may have about the client that is not
                  directly provided as part of the LDAP protocol layer.  It is most commonly in the
                  form of an SSL client certificate.  The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java, JNDI, and
                  the Netscape Directory SDK for Java all provide support for this mechanism.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>GSSAPI</b> -- This is a mechanism that can be used to leverage an existing
                  Kerberos V authentication session.  The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java provides
                  support for this mechanism using a relatively simple API.  JNDI can use it
                  through the Java SASL framework, although this can be complex to use properly.
                  The Netscape Directory SDK for Java does not support the use of GSSAPI.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>PLAIN</b> -- This is a mechanism that can be used to authenticate using an
                  authentication ID and password, and optionally allows the specification of an
                  alternate authorization identity.  The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java provides
                  support for this mechanism.  The Netscape Directory SDK for Java does not.  JNDI
                  can use it through the Java SASL framework, although this is significantly more
                  complex than the API exposed by the UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java.

              <p></p>
              <h3>Password Policy Interaction</h3>

              <p>
                Some directory servers have rich password policy functionality, which can provide
                capabilities like ensuring users have strong passwords, requiring users to change
                their passwords regularly, requiring users to authenticate securely, and locking
                accounts after too many failed attempts.  In order to provide the best possible
                user experience, the client should be able to interact with the directory server's
                password policy when appropriate.
              </p>

              <p>
                One of the simplest ways that a client can interact with the directory server
                password policy is to be able to distinguish when the user's password has expired
                or is about to expire.  This information is commonly returned in the password
                expired / password expiring controls as defined in draft-vchu-ldap-pwd-policy.
                Both the UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java and the Netscape Directory SDK for Java
                provide support for this control.  JNDI does not.
              </p>

              <p>
                Another key aspect of password policy integration is the ability to change user
                passwords in the directory.  It is true that most servers support changing client
                passwords using standard LDAP modify operations, but RFC 3062 defines a special
                extended operation that may be used for this purpose as well.  It also includes
                provisions for allowing users to include their current password as part of
                specifying a new password, as well as allowing the server to automatically generate
                a new password for the client.  The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java provides support
                for this password modify extended operation, while it is not available for use with
                either JNDI or the Netscape Directory SDK for Java.
              </p>

              <p>
                The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java also provides enhanced password policy interaction
                when it is used to communicate with an UnboundID Directory Server instance.  Note,
                however, that these capabilities are not fully standardized and therefore they may
                not work with other servers and are only supported when interacting with an
                UnboundID server.  These additional capabilities include:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Support for the password policy control as defined in
                  draft-behera-ldap-password-policy.  This control may be used to get warning
                  and/or error information about interactions with a user's password policy.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Support for the account usability control.  This control may be used to determine
                  whether an account is currently usable, and if not the reason that it is
                  unavailable.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Support for the password policy state extended operation.  This control may be
                  used to retrieve and alter virtually any kind of password policy state
                  information for a user.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p></p>
              <h3>Atomic Operations</h3>

              <p>
                Directory servers are often highly concurrent applications and can process many
                requests at the same time.  Similarly, directory servers are generally deployed in
                replicated configurations so that operations can be processed at the same time
                across multiple servers.  The nature of these kinds of environments means that it
                can be difficult to ensure that multiple clients aren't trying to access and/or
                alter the same data at the same time.  If client A reads an entry from a directory
                and then sends an update to modify that entry based on what it read, it could be
                highly undesirable for client B to modify the entry after client A has performed
                the read but before it has performed the modify.  Allowing data to be modified in
                unexpected ways can be a significant security problem, and it can be important to
                ensure that there are ways of preventing such problems.
              </p>

              <p>
                Protection against these kinds of problems often comes in the form of various types
                of atomic operations.  The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java supports a number of
                features that may fit into this category:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  LDAP increment modify extension (RFC 4525) -- This enhancement to the modify
                  operation allows a client to request that the integer value of an attribute be
                  incremented or decremented by a specified amount.  The client does not need to
                  know what the current value is, but only how much it should be incremented or
                  decremented.  Neither JNDI nor the Netscape Directory SDK for Java directly
                  support this feature.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  LDAP read entry controls (RFC 4527) -- These controls allow a client to retrieve
                  an entry exactly as it appeared either immediately before or immediately after
                  performing a write operation so that it can be sure of the contents of the
                  updated entry at the time of the write operation (it is particularly useful in
                  conjunction with the increment modify extension).  Neither JNDI nor the Netscape
                  Directory SDK for Java include support for these controls.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  LDAP assertion control (RFC 4528) -- This control can be used to ensure that the
                  target entry matches a specified filter before performing an operation against
                  it.  This allows clients to ensure that the information that it used to determine
                  what to include in the update has not changed since the client read the entry.
                  Neither JNDI nor the Netscape Directory SDK for Java include support for this
                  control.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Batched Transactions (based on draft-zeilenga-ldap-txn) -- This specification
                  defines a pair of extended operations and a control that may be used to allow
                  multiple write operations to be processed using the same transaction and
                  therefore applied atomically.  Neither JNDI nor the Netscape Directory SDK for
                  Java include support for this capability.  Note, however, that because this
                  specification has not yet been fully standardized, it is extremely unlike that
                  the implementation included in the UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java will work with any
                  server other than the UnboundID Directory Server.  As such, it is only available
                  in the Commercial Edition of the LDAP SDK for Java.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Interactive Transactions (UnboundID-specific) -- This allows a client to request
                  that multiple operations, including both write operations (like add, delete,
                  modify, and modify DN) and read operations (like search and compare), be
                  performed as a single atomic unit using a transaction.  Neither JNDI nor the
                  Netscape Directory SDK for Java provide support for this capability.  This
                  capability is only available in the Commercial Edition of the LDAP SDK for Java
                  and may only be used with the UnboundID Directory Server.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

              <h3>Search Filter Construction</h3>

              <p>
                One of the most common security problems for applications that interact with
                relational databases is that of SQL injection attacks.  In this case, a malicious
                user knows that what gets entered into a form will be directly included in an SQL
                query, and that entering a specially-crafted value may result in a significantly
                different behavior than the application developer intended, potentially even
                exposing sensitive data or allowing information to be altered in unexpected ways.
              </p>

              <p>
                While it is unlikely that this kind of attack can be used to alter the contents of
                a directory server, it is certainly not inconceivable that it could be used to
                expose sensitive data or at least more data than the application developer
                intended.  For example, consider a simple address book lookup application with a
                form that allows the user to enter the name of the user for whom to search.  This
                is a very common application, and it is very common for it to generate a filter
                using an algorithm that looks something like the following:
              </p>

              <pre>
String filter = "(|(cn=" + searchText + ")(sn=" + searchText +
                ")(givenName=" + searchText + "))";
</pre>

              <p>
                However, consider the case in which the user entered something like
                "<tt>X)(objectClass=*</tt>".  The application may then get tricked into sending a
                search to the directory with a filter that looks like
                "<tt>(|(cn=X)(objectClass=*)(givenName=X)(objectClass=*)(sn=X)(objectClass=*))</tt>",
                and the directory may reveal much more information than it should.
              </p>

              <p>
                One way to thwart these kinds of attacks is for developers to make sure that they
                either restrict the kinds of information they will allow to be entered, or to
                sanitize the input before using it in the filter.  This can work, but it introduces
                the possibility that the restrictions on input data can interfere with the ability
                to perform legitimate searches, or that some special cases may be overlooked when
                the data is sanitized so that vulnerabilities remain.
              </p>

              <p>
                The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java provides an alternative mechanism to address this
                problem in the form of filter construction.  Rather than creating a string
                representation of the filter, it is possible to construct a filter by specifying
                the components that it should contain.  For example, the following code would
                produce a search filter like the one above but without the possibility of malicious
                input producing unexpected results:
              </p>

              <pre>
Filter filter = Filter.createANDFilter(
     Filter.createEqualityFilter("cn", searchText),
     Filter.createEqualityFilter("sn", searchText),
     Filter.createEqualityFilter("givenName", searchText));
</pre>

              <p>
                With the above code, even if a malicious user entered something like
                "<tt>X)(objectClass=*</tt>" into the search field, the LDAP SDK would properly
                handle it and the filter that got sent to the server would actually be the
                equivalent of
                "<tt>(|(cn=X\29\28objectClass=\2A)(sn=X\29\28objectClass=\2A)(givenName=X\29\28objectClass=\2A))</tt>".
              </p>

              <p>
                Not only does this reduce or eliminate the need to sanitize the data, it is also
                more efficient because the SDK doesn't have to parse the filter string because it's
                already given the data in the form that it needs to encode the filter for sending
                to the server.
              </p>

              <h3>Get Effective Rights Control</h3>

              <p>
                The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java provides support for a get effective rights control
                which may be used by clients in order to determine the capabilities that a user has
                when interacting with a specified entry in the directory.  It can be used to
                determine whether a given user would have permission to perform a requested
                operation.  This could be used to allow an application to customize the interface
                that it presents to a user so that operations which the user does not have rights
                to perform are not made available.
              </p>

              <p>
                Note that the get effective rights control is only supported for use in conjunction
                with the UnboundID Directory Server.
