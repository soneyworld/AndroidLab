              <h2>Support for Asynchronous Operations</h2>

              <p>
                LDAP allows clients to process multiple concurrent operations over a single
                connection.  This can be useful for clients who wish to share a connection across
                multiple threads, or who wish to provide support for operations like abandon or the
                cancel extended operation to interrupt processing of another operation already in
                progress.
              </p>

              <p>
                JNDI does not provide any direct support for processing asynchronous operations.
                It is possible to share a single JNDI context between threads, but it does not
                expose any API that would allow clients to have more control over asynchronous
                operation processing.  In addition, JNDI does not expose support for either the
                abandon operation or the cancel extended operation.
              </p>

              <p>
                The Netscape Directory SDK for Java allows a single connection to be shared across
                multiple client threads, but it also provides an explicit API for processing
                asynchronous operations.  In this case, the operation must be invoked using a
                response listener, and that response listener will provide a queue that the client
                can then poll to determine whether the response has arrived.  However, a poll-based
                mechanism is not always desirable, and it appears to have some shortcomings if the
                same listener is used to handle responses for multiple asynchronous operations.
              </p>

              <p>
                Like JNDI and the Netscape SDK, the UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java allows a single
                connection to be shared across multiple client threads.  It also provides
                additional support for asynchronous operations.  However, unlike the Netscape
                Directory SDK for Java, it accomplishes this using a notification mechanism rather
                than requiring the client to periodically check to see if the response has been
                received (however, it is simple for clients to place the results in something like
                a <tt>LinkedBlockingQueue</tt> if they would prefer a poll-based approach).
