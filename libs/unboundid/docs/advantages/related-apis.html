              <h2>Inclusion of Related APIs</h2>

              <p>
                Developers who create directory-enabled applications, or administrators who create
                applications to help manage the directory, frequently need to go beyond what is
                possible using LDAP communication.  Further, even when the desired tasks are
                accessible over LDAP, it may be necessary to prepare the data in some way, or to
                extend the capabilities of the SDK by adding support for things like custom
                controls, extended operations, or SASL mechanisms.  It may also be helpful to
                provide mechanisms for interpreting special kinds of data returned by the server.
              </p>

              <p>
                The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java provides the following components for helping to
                accomplish these tasks:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>LDIF processing.</b>  LDIF is the standard way to represent LDAP entries and
                  change records in text form, and the UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java provides rich
                  support for reading and writing LDIF content, as well as using LDIF content as a
                  way to directly process operations.  The Netscape Directory SDK for Java
                  provides support for reading and writing LDIF content, but its support is
                  relatively compartmentalized so that it is separate from other parts of the SDK
                  and it is necessary to perform translations in order to convert a change record
                  to an operation, or to represent an entry as LDIF.  JNDI does not provide any
                  level of support for LDIF interaction.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Base64 processing.</b>  Base64 is a mechanism for representing raw data in a
                  form that can be safely displayed using only printable characters.  It is used in
                  LDIF processing for encoding entry DNs and attribute values that may have special
                  characters, and it is commonly used in other areas where binary data may need to
                  be represented in a human-readable form (e.g., hashed or encrypted passwords,
                  certificates, etc.).  The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java provides a simple and
                  convenient class for performing base64 encoding and decoding.  The Netscape
                  Directory SDK for Java provides a mechanism for performing base64 encoding and
                  decoding, but it is much less convenient to use.  JNDI does not provide a
                  supported mechanism for performing base64 encoding or decoding.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>ASN.1 BER processing.</b>  LDAP communication uses a binary protocol encoded
                  using the ASN.1 basic encoding rules (BER).  The core protocol uses it, as well
                  as extensions like controls, extended operations, and SASL mechanisms.  If you
                  wish to extend the LDAP SDK to support new types of these elements, then it is
                  likely that it will be necessary to perform ASN.1 encoding and decoding.  The
                  UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java has a relatively simple mechanism for accomplishing
                  this task.  The Netscape Directory SDK for Java also provides support for ASN.1
                  encoding and decoding, but it is only intended for interacting with input and
                  output streams which makes it very poorly-suited for use in encoding and decoding
                  custom extensions.  JNDI does not provide any facility for performing ASN.1
                  encoding or decoding.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Root DSE parsing.</b>  The root DSE is a special type of entry in the
                  directory server that provides information about the capabilities that it
                  provides (e.g., what kinds of controls, extended operations, features, and SASL
                  mechanisms it might support, information about the data hierarchy, and vendor
                  name and version information).  This information is accessible over LDAP by
                  retrieving the  entry with a zero-length DN.  Since it is a regular LDAP entry,
                  both JNDI and the Netscape Directory SDK for Java allow clients to retrieve that
                  entry and access the information that it contains, but they do not provide any
                  facility that might help the developer interpret the information it contains.
                  The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java provides enhanced support for accessing the
                  information contained in the server root DSE so that it can be used in meaningful
                  ways by client applications.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Schema parsing.</b>  Like the root DSE, directory servers publish information
                  about the schema elements that they support, and it is very useful for clients to
                  be able to access and utilize this information.  For example, an application
                  intended to allow clients to search, browse, and/or alter the contents of the
                  directory need to be able to access the server schema so that they know what
                  types of entries can be created, and which attributes are required and optional
                  for each type of entry.  JNDI provides limited support for parsing schema
                  elements, although it is a rather inconvenient API and does not expose all types
                  of schema elements, nor does it expose all information about the schema elements
                  that it does support.  The Netscape Directory SDK for Java provides a better
                  interface for accessing the server schema than JNDI, and does appear to support
                  all types of schema elements and exposes all available fields.  The UnboundID
                  LDAP SDK for Java provides full support for parsing all types of schema elements
                  and provides access to all components of those schema elements, and it also
                  provides support for a number of schema-aware operations like client-side
                  matching, sorting, and filter evaluation.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Changelog entry parsing.</b>  The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java provides the
                  ability to parse changelog entries which are used by directory servers to publish
                  information about changes processed in the server, in the format described in
                  <TT>draft-good-ldap-changelog</TT>.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>SSL/TLS communication helper classes.</b>  The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java
                  provides utility classes that help make it easier to perform secure communication
                  using SSL/TLS.  Simplified interfaces are provided for automatically trusting any
                  certificate, interactively prompting users about whether a certificate should be
                  trusted, or using a key store to determine whether a server certificate should be
                  trusted.  It also simplifies the process of obtaining client certificates from a
                  key store file or a PKCS#11 token.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Command line argument parsing.</b>  Many administrative utilities for
                  interacting with directory servers are written as command line applications, and
                  are configured using arguments.  To facilitate the development of such
                  applications, the UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java provides a very powerful and
                  flexible argument parser which can make it easy for applications to validate and
                  extract the arguments provided in useful ways.  It also provides the ability to
                  generate program usage information from the defined arguments.  The Netscape
                  Directory SDK for Java has a very primitive mechanism for parsing command line
                  arguments, but it does not have any support for generating usage information and
                  leaves a lot of the work to the application developer.  JNDI does not provide
                  any capability for argument parsing.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Simple LDAP-enabled tool creation.</b>  It is relatively simple to create
                  command line tools that communicate with an LDAP directory server.  It provides
                  all of the logic for parsing arguments needed for connecting and authenticating
                  to the directory server and provides the ability to create connections and
                  connection pools using those arguments.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Entry source API.</b>  This is an API that provides simple access to a stream
                  of entries independent of the source for those entries.  Using the entry source
                  API, it is simple to write code that can work identically when processing entries
                  in an LDIF file or returned by a directory server as part of a search operation.
                  <br><br>
