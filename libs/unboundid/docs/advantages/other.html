              <h2>Other Advantages of the UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java</h2>

              This page describes some of the additional advantages that the UnboundID LDAP SDK
              offers over other Java-based LDAP APIs.

              <p></p>
              <h3>Default Protocol Version</h3>

              <p>
                The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java uses LDAPv3 as the default protocol version, and
                it does not provide support for LDAPv2.  LDAPv2 is a deprecated version of the
                protocol (as per <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3494.txt">RFC 3494</a>) and
                should not be used for new development.  It does not support features like
                controls, extended operations, and referrals, and has frequently caused problems
                for LDAP clients trying to use these features when they were unknowingly using
                LDAPv2 instead of LDAPv3.  This is a particularly common problem with clients
                developed using the Netscape Directory SDK for Java, since it uses LDAPv2 by
                default and it is necessary to override that each time you perform a bind.  JNDI
                offers support for both LDAPv2 and LDAPv3, but appears to use LDAPv3 by default.
              </p>

              <p></p>
              <h3>Improved Disconnect Handling</h3>

              <p>
                Well-designed LDAP clients generally maintain connections that are established for
                long periods of time that are reused for many requests rather than establishing
                separate connections for each operation.  This is much more efficient and
                dramatically reduces the load on both the client and the server.  However, this
                can cause problems if a connection becomes invalid for some reason (e.g., if the
                directory server is restarted, terminates the client connection, or becomes
                unavailable as a result of a network problem).  The client needs to be able to
                detect and handle this kind of problem, and failure to do so properly has been
                responsible for many problems with directory-enabled applications.  The UnboundID
                LDAP SDK for Java offers a number of features that can help make this easier:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  The LDAP SDK provides a <tt>DisconnectHandler</tt> API that can be used to
                  notify the client whenever it detects that a connection is no longer available.
                  This disconnect notification may also include additional information about the
                  reason for the disconnect.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  It is possible to configure LDAP connections so that they automatically attempt
                  to re-establish themselves in the event of an unexpected disconnect.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  The <tt>ResultCode</tt> class provides a method for determining whether an
                  error result may indicate that the connection should be terminated and
                  re-established or if it may safely continue to be used.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  When using a connection pool, the pool itself will take care of detecting
                  invalid connections and automatically re-establishing them.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  When using server sets and connection pools together, the LDAP SDK provides the
                  ability to automatically fail over to another server if one server becomes
                  unavailable.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p></p>
              <h3>Client-Side Entry Sorting</h3>

              <p>
                Many directory servers support the use of the server-side sort control as
                described in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2891.txt">RFC 2891</a>, and the
                UnboundID LDAP SDK provides support for using this control.  However, some
                directory servers do not support this control, and of those that do it may be an
                expensive operation to perform the operation on the server side and/or may require
                special configuration to allow it.
              </p>

              <p>
                A good alternative to server-side sorting is to perform the work on the client,
                particularly for small result sets.  JNDI does not provide any support for this
                capability.  The Netscape Directory SDK for Java provides some level of support
                for client-side sorting, but it is limited to simple lexicographic ordering.  The
                UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java provides a much more full-featured
                <tt>EntrySorter</tt> class which includes the ability to perform syntax-based
                sorting using information read from the server schema, as well as including
                information about the location of the entry in the DIT.  This class implements
                the <tt>Comparator</tt> interface, so it can also be used in conjunction with any
                type of collection that uses that interface for sorting.
              </p>

              <p></p>
              <h3>Client-Side Schema Validation</h3>

              <p>
                The LDAP specifications provide the ability for servers to define very rich schema
                support that can be used to define constraints for the contents of entries.  When
                adding a new entry or altering an existing entry, it could be helpful to know
                whether that change complies with the server schema so that the client can avoid
                sending a request to the server that it knows will be rejected.
              </p>

              <p>
                JNDI does not provide any ability for parsing schema elements.  The Netscape
                Directory SDK for Java offers the ability to read and parse schema elements, but
                it does not include any facility for helping to determine whether an entry may be
                valid.  The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java, however, provides very rich support for
                this in the form of the <tt>EntryValidator</tt> class.  This class provides
                support for the following types of validation:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Ensure that the entry has a valid, well-formed DN.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Ensure that the entry has exactly one structural object class.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Ensure that all object classes contained in an entry are defined in the server
                  schema.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Ensure that all auxiliary object classes for the entry are allowed by any DIT
                  content rule associated with the entry's structural object class.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Ensure that all attributes included in the entry are defined in the server
                  schema.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Ensure that all attributes required by the entry's object classes and DIT
                  content rule are present in the entry.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Ensure that all user attributes contained in the entry are allowed by the
                  entry's object classes and DIT content rule.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Ensure that all attribute values conform to the requirements of the associated
                  attribute syntax.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Ensure that all attributes with multiple values are defined as multi-valued in
                  the server schema.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Ensure that the entry DN conforms to the requirements of any name form
                  associated with the entry's structural object class.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                The <tt>EntryValidator</tt> class is configurable, and each of these checks can be
                enabled or disabled individually.  If any problems are detected while parsing an
                entry, then human-readable explanations of those problems will be made available.
                The <tt>validate-ldif</tt> tool provided as an example tool with the LDAP SDK
                takes advantage of this class and can be used to ensure that an LDIF file is clean
                before attempting to import it.
              </p>

              <p></p>
              <h3>Entry Comparison</h3>

              <p>
                There are a number of cases in which it is useful to be able to compare two
                entries and identify any differences between them.  For example, if an application
                provides the ability to alter the contents of an entry, then it will be
                necessary for that application to determine what changes were made in order to
                send the appropriate modify request to the server.  Alternately, it may be useful
                to compare entries on different servers to determine whether they are in sync.
              </p>

              <p>
                Neither JNDI nor the Netscape Directory SDK for Java provide any direct support
                for this, so any applications which wish to compare entries must implement the
                logic for themselves.  This can be tricky, and there are a number of things to
                consider.  To help with such cases, the UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java provides a
                simple <tt>Entry.diff</tt> method which may be used to compare entries and
                identify any differences between them.  The differences will be returned as a set
                of modifications that can be applied to the source entry in order to make it look
                like the target entry.  It provides the ability to restrict the comparison to a
                specified set of attributes, and also to optionally ignore differences in RDN
                attribute values.
              </p>

              <p></p>
              <h3>Provided Example Tools</h3>

              <p>
                While having documentation available is important, one of the best ways to learn
                how to use an API is to see examples using that API.  The Netscape Directory SDK
                for Java provides <tt>LDAPSearch</tt>, <tt>LDAPModify</tt>, and
                <tt>LDAPDelete</tt> tools that can be used to demonstrate the ability to perform
                various types of LDAP operations.  JNDI does not provide any.  The set of example
                tools provided with the UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java include:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <tt>LDAPCompare</tt> -- Provides a tool that demonstrates the process for
                  performing LDAP compare operations.  It also demonstrates the command-line
                  argument parsing and LDAP command-line tool APIs.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <tt>LDAPModify</tt> -- Provides a tool that demonstrates the process for reading
                  changes from LDIF and processing them as add, delete, modify, or modify DN
                  operations.  It also demonstrates the command-line argument parsing and LDAP
                  command-line tool APIs.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <tt>LDAPSearch</tt> -- Provides a tool that demonstrates the process for
                  performing LDAP search operations.  It also demonstrates the command-line
                  argument parsing and LDAP command-line tool APIs.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <tt>ModRate</tt> -- Provides a tool that may be used to perform repeated
                  modifications against a directory server to measure modify performance.  It
                  demonstrates the command-line argument parsing, LDAP command-line tool, and
                  value pattern APIs.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <tt>SearchRate</tt> -- Provides a tool that may be used to perform repeated
                  searches against a directory server to measure search performance.  It
                  demonstrates the command-line argument parsing, LDAP command-line tool, and
                  value pattern APIs.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <tt>ValidateLDIF</tt> -- Provides a tool that may be used to validate that the
                  contents of an LDIF file are valid in accordance with a server schema.  It
                  demonstrates the LDIF reading and writing, command-line argument parsing, LDAP
                  command-line tool, and schema processing APIs.
                  <br><br>
