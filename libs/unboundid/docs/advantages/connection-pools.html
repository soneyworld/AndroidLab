              <h2>Improved Connection Pooling</h2>

              <p>
                JNDI provides basic support for connection pooling through the use of the
                "<tt>com.sun.jndi.ldap.connect.pool</tt>" property (although it is not clear
                whether this property is available in non-Sun Java implementations).  If this
                property is set to "true" in the environment properties when creating a context,
                then the JNDI implementation will create a connection pool that will create
                connections as needed, but return connections from the pool when they are
                available.  There is virtually no control over the properties of the connection
                pool, nor is it possible to have multiple connection pools within the same JVM
                instance.  While it is relatively nice that JNDI connection pooling is largely
                transparent to the client, it requires that clients be designed with a relatively
                poor pattern of closing connections after each sequence of operations, which will
                return them to the pool if there is one, but can easily lead to the unintended
                behavior of repeatedly creating and tearing down connections.
              </p>

              <p>
                The Netscape Directory SDK for Java provides basic connection pooling support
                through the <tt>netscape.ldap.util.ConnectionPool</tt> class.  Connections are
                checked out from the pool using the <tt>getConnection</tt> method, which may block
                if the pool does not have any available connections.  Connections are returned to
                the pool by calling the rather unintuitive <tt>close</tt> method.  It requires
                clients to be developed with explicit knowledge of and interaction with the
                connection pool, and it does not provide any capability for performing operations
                within the context of the pool itself.
              </p>

              <p>
                The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java provides an enhanced connection pooling mechanism
                that provides many of the good aspects of the JNDI and Netscape implementations
                without the negatives, and also provides additional functionality.  The connection
                pooling implementation provided by the UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java has the
                following properties:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  It is possible to have multiple distinct connection pools in use by the same
                  application or different applications within the same JVM.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  It is possible to explicitly check out and release connections.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  It is possible to lazily create connections as needed.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  It is possible to indicate that a connection may have become invalidated when
                  releasing a connection to indicate that it should no longer be used by the pool.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  It is possible to configure the connection pooling to specify whether it should
                  block if no connections are available and if so for how long.  It is also
                  possible to configure whether it should attempt to create a new connection if
                  none are available.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  It provides support for processing operations within the context of the pool, so
                  processing those operations will automatically check out and return the
                  connection and perform all necessary error handling, without requiring the client
                  developer to concern themselves with those details.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  It provides a method for processing multiple operations over the same pooled
                  connection without the need for the caller to perform the necessary connection
                  management or error handling.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  It implements the same <tt>LDAPInterface</tt> interface as the
                  <tt>LDAPConnection</tt> class.  This means that clients can be developed to use
                  <tt>LDAPInterface</tt> objects instead of <tt>LDAPConnection</tt> objects in
                  cases where it doesn't matter if the operation is performed on an individual
                  connection or a pooled connection.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  It works in conjunction with the <A HREF="failover-load-balancing.html">Support
                  for Failover and Load Balancing</A> so that the pool can contain connections to
                  multiple servers, allowing the load to be spread between them.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java also offers a second connection pool
                implementation that provides the ability to define separate servers (or sets of
                servers) for read and write operations.  With this read-write connection pool,
                one set of connections will be established for write operations like add, delete,
                modify, and modify DN operations, and another set of connections (potentially
                established to a different set of servers) will be used for read operations like
                search, bind, and compare operations.  This can be useful for environments
                containing a number of read-only replicas that cannot accept write operations.
