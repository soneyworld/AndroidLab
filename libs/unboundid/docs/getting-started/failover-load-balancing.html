              <h2>Client-Side Failover and Load Balancing</h2>

              <p>
                The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java provides basic support for client-side failover and
                load balancing through the <tt>ServerSet</tt> class.  Whenever it attempts to
                create a connection to a directory server, the LDAP SDK can use a
                <tt>ServerSet</tt> instance to establish that connection.  If the server set is
                configured with information about multiple directory servers, then it will be
                responsible for selecting which server to use and establishing the connection.  If
                the initially-selected server is not available, then it may attempt to connect to
                one or more of the other defined servers before giving up and throwing an
                exception.
              </p>

              <p>
                It is also possible to create an <tt>LDAPConnectionPool</tt> instance using a
                server set, and in that case that server set will be used to create each connection
                that is part of the pool.  This may allow a pool to be created with connections to
                multiple servers, which can provide a basic form of client-side load balancing.
              </p>

              <p>
                The LDAP SDK is currently provided with the following server set implementations:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <tt>SingleServerSet</tt> -- This is a simple server set implementation that can
                  be used to hold information about a single server.  It can be used for cases in
                  which a server set is required, but only a single server is to be used.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <tt>RoundRobinServerSet</tt> -- This server set implementation can hold
                  information about multiple servers and each subsequent call to the
                  <tt>getConnection</tt> method will attempt to retrieve a connection to the next
                  server in the list (if any of the servers is unavailable, then it will be
                  skipped).  This can be used to try to evenly spread load across a group of
                  servers.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <tt>FailoverServerSet</tt> -- This server set implementation can hold information
                  about multiple servers or server sets, and will always attempt to obtain a
                  connection from a server or server set in the order they were provided (i.e.,
                  always try to get a connection to server A first, but if it is unavailable then
                  try server "B", then server "C", etc.).  The ability to fail over across server
                  sets also provides a powerful capability because it enables more complex
                  policies, like always using round-robin to balance requests across servers in the
                  local data center, but if none of them are available then it can attempt to use a
                  round-robin set containing servers in a remote data center.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p></p>
              <h3>Using Server Sets to Establish Single Connections</h3>

              <p>
                If you wish to create individual connections using a server set, then it is only
                necessary to call the <tt>getConnection()</tt> method for that server set.  For
                example:
              </p>

              <pre>
String[] addresses = { "server1.example.com", "server2.example.com" };
int[]    ports     = { 389, 389 };

FailoverServerSet failoverSet = new FailoverServerSet(addresses, ports);
LDAPConnection connection = failoverSet.getConnection();
</pre>

              <p>
                Note that in most cases, it is desirable to create a server set ahead of time and
                keep a reference to it to be used whenever a new connection is to be created.  In
                fact, this is necessary if you want to be able to fully utilize the capabilities of
                some server sets.  For example, the round robin server set always loops through the
                servers in the order they were provided, so if you create an instance of the round
                robin server set and then immediately use it to obtain a connection, then that
                connection will always be established to the first server (unless it happens to be
                unavailable, in which case it will try other servers in the list in the provided
                order).  All of the server set implementations provided as part of the UnboundID
                LDAP SDK for Java are threadsafe, so the <tt>getConnection</tt> method may be
                called concurrently by separate threads.
              </p>

              <p></p>
              <h3>Using Server Sets to Create Connection Pools</h3>

              <p>
                It is also possible to use a server set when creating a connection pool.  In that
                case, all of the connections in that pool will be created by the server set, and
                therefore the pool may contain connections to multiple different servers.  For
                example:
              </p>

              <pre>
String[] addresses = { "server1.example.com", "server2.example.com" };
int[]    ports     = { 389, 389 };

RoundRobinServerSet roundRobinSet = new RoundRobinServerSet(addresses, ports);
BindRequest bindRequest =
     new SimpleBindRequest("uid=pool.user,dc=example,dc=com", "password");
LDAPConnectionPool pool =
     new LDAPConnectionPool(roundRobinSet, bindRequest, 10);
</pre>

              <p>
                The above example will create a connection pool with ten connections that are
                authenticated as the "uid=pool.user,dc=example,dc=com" user.  If both servers are
                available, then the pool will have five connections each to server1.example.com:389
                and server2.example.com:389, and operations processed in the pool should be roughly
                evenly balanced between the two servers.
