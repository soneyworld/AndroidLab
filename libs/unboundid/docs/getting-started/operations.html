              <h2>Performing LDAP Operations</h2>

              <p>
                <tt>LDAPConnection</tt> objects provide a number of methods for processing
                operations against an LDAP directory server.  This document provides basic
                information about processing such operations.
              </p>

              <p></p>
              <h3>Operation Requests</h3>

              <p>
                The <tt>LDAPConnection</tt> object provides a number of convenience methods for
                processing different types of operations, but for each operation there is also a
                method that takes an <tt>LDAPRequest</tt> subclass (e.g., <tt>AddRequest</tt> for
                add operations, <tt>BindRequest</tt> for bind operations, etc.).  In most cases,
                these request objects are mutable and can be altered and re-used across multiple
                requests.  This makes it possible, for example, to construct a search request for a
                common type of request that the application needs to make, and simply alter the
                filter and re-send the updated request without the need to create a completely new
                request object.
              </p>

              <p>
                Using request objects also provides a greater set of options than the most
                commonly-used options provided through the methods in the <tt>LDAPConnection</tt>
                class.  In particular, it is possible to include controls in these requests, which
                is not available with the other methods used to request operations in the
                <tt>LDAPConnection</tt> class, and you can also use it to specify a timeout for the
                operation that differs from the default timeout specified in the associated
                connection options.  Further, it is necessary to use these request objects if you
                wish to process asynchronous operations.  Note, however, that request objects
                themselves are not threadsafe and therefore a single request object should not be
                used to process multiple concurrent operations.
              </p>

              <p></p>
              <h3>Operation Results</h3>

              <p>
                All operations listed below other than those in the "Other Convenience Methods"
                section return an <tt>LDAPResult</tt> object (or one of its subclasses), which
                includes the following information:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  The LDAP result code for the operation.
                 </li>

                <li>
                  The matched DN string (if one was provided)
                </li>

                <li>
                  A diagnostic message providing additional information about the result (if one
                  was provided)
                </li>

                <li>
                  The referral URLs (if any were provided)
                </li>

                <li>
                  The response controls for the operation (if any were provided)
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                When processing synchronous operations (which is the case for all operations
                described on this page), the LDAP SDK will only return an <tt>LDAPResult</tt>
                object when the operation completes successfully.  For operations that do not
                complete successfully, it will instead throw an <tt>LDAPException</tt>.
                <tt>LDAPException</tt> objects include all of the same elements as an
                <tt>LDAPResult</tt> object, so all of the above information will still be
                available.  The added benefit of throwing an exception in this case, however, is
                that it eliminates the need for the caller to have to explicitly check the result
                code of the operation to determine if it was successful.
              </p>

              <p>
                The types of result that may be returned include:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Add, delete, modify, and modify DN operations return simple <tt>LDAPResult</tt>
                  objects.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Bind operations return <tt>BindResult</tt> objects, which may include an optional
                  server SASL credentials element.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Compare operations return <tt>CompareResult</tt> objects, which provide a
                  convenience method for indicating whether the compare assertion matched the
                  target entry.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Extended operations return <tt>ExtendedResult</tt> objects, which may include a
                  response OID and/or value.  Subclasses for specific types of extended operations
                  may provide other methods for accessing the content of the response.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Search operations return <tt>SearchResult</tt> objects, which include the number
                  of entries and referrals returned, and may also hold the returned entries and/or
                  references.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p></p>
              <h3>Processing Search Operations</h3>

              <p>
                Search operations differ from other types of LDAP operations in that there may be
                multiple responses to a single request.  In addition to the search result done
                message, each entry and reference is returned in a separate message.  As a result,
                processing such operations in the LDAP SDK is somewhat different than for other
                operations.
              </p>

              <p>
                There are two basic ways to perform search operations in the UnboundID LDAP SDK for
                Java.  One approach, which works for all types of searches, is to use the
                <tt>SearchResultListener</tt> interface.  If a search request includes a reference
                to a <tt>SearchResultListener</tt>, then its <tt>searchEntryReturned</tt> method
                will be called for each entry returned from the server.  Further, if the server
                returns referrals as part of the search operation and the connection is not
                configured to automatically follow referrals, then the listener's
                <tt>searchReferenceReturned</tt> method will be called so that the referral can be
                handled.
              </p>

              <p>
                If no <tt>SearchResultListener</tt> is provided as part of the search request, then
                the SDK will collect all search result entries and references and include them in
                the <tt>SearchResult</tt> object that is returned from the search.  This is
                significantly more convenient, but does introduce a risk of running out of
                available memory on the client if a search matches a very large number of entries.
                If a search request may cause the server to return a large number of entries, then
                it should use a <tt>SearchResultListener</tt> to process the entries as they are
                returned rather than attempting to collect them all in memory until the search is
                complete.
              </p>

              <p></p>
              <h3>Other Convenience Methods</h3>

              <p>
                In addition to methods that may be used for performing standard LDAP operations,
                the <tt>LDAPConnection</tt> class provides methods that may be useful when
                interacting with the server.
              </p>

              <p>
                If you wish to retrieve a single entry from the server and you know the DN of that
                entry, then you could use a search operation to retrieve that entry, but you may
                also use one of the <tt>getEntry</tt> methods.  These methods allow you to specify
                just the DN of the entry (and optionally a set of attributes to include in the
                entry) and will return the requested entry if it exists.
              </p>

              <p>
                The directory server's root DSE is a special entry with a zero-length DN that
                provides information about the capabilities of the server.  This may include
                information like the base DNs for data in the directory, supported controls and
                extended operations, and product version information.  The <tt>LDAPConnection</tt>
                class provides a <tt>getRootDSE</tt> method that may be used to retrieve and parse
                the server root DSE.
              </p>

              <p>
                The directory server also publishes schema information about the attribute types,
                object classes, syntaxes, and other schema elements that it supports.  The
                <tt>getSchema</tt> method may be used to retrieve a <tt>Schema</tt> object that
                includes parsed versions of the server schema elements so that the client can
                determine the types of information that may be stored in the directory.
