              <h2>Processing Asynchronous Operations</h2>

              <p>
                Most LDAP clients use a synchronous model for processing requests.  In this case,
                the client will send a request and then wait until it receives the response from
                the server before continuing.  However, the LDAP protocol allows for asynchronous
                operations, in which there may be multiple concurrent requests in progress for the
                same connection.
              </p>

              <p>
                There are two primary ways that the UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java can be used to
                process multiple operations on the same connection at the same time:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Multiple client threads can use the same <tt>LDAPConnection</tt> object at the
                  same time.  <tt>LDAPConnection</tt> objects are threadsafe (although individual
                  request objects are not, so the same request object should not be shared by
                  multiple threads at the same time), so they can be used by multiple concurrent
                  client threads as long as they conform to the requirements outlined below.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Clients can use the asynchronous operation API provided by the UnboundID LDAP SDK
                  for Java.  In this case, the SDK will send the request to the server, but will
                  not wait for the response to arrive before returning.  The client can continue
                  with other processing and then will be notified when the response arrives.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Note, however, that LDAP does place restrictions on asynchronous operation
                processing.  In particular, bind operations and StartTLS operations must always be
                processed in a synchronous manner.  If a client is going to process asynchronous
                operations, then it must take care to ensure that it does not attempt to process
                bind or StartTLS operations while other operations may be in progress.
              </p>

              <p>
                Also note that some directory servers may enforce restrictions on the number of
                concurrent operations that may be in progress on a single connection at any given
                time, and even in cases where that is not performed it is likely the case that
                there may be more contention when processing concurrent operations on a single
                connection than if they were processed over separate connections.  Therefore, it
                should be noted that attempting to process too many concurrent operations over a
                connection may have a performance impact.
              </p>

              <p>
                The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java provides the following methods for processing
                asynchronous write operations:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <tt>public AsyncRequestID asyncAdd(AddRequest addRequest, AsyncResultListener
                  resultListener)</tt>
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <tt>public AsyncRequestID asyncDelete(DeleteRequest deleteRequest,
                  AsyncResultListener resultListener)</tt>
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <tt>public AsyncRequestID asyncModify(ModifyRequest modifyRequest,
                  AsyncResultListener resultListener)</tt>
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <tt>public AsyncRequestID asyncModifyDN(ModifyDNRequest modifyDNRequest,
                  AsyncResultListener resultListener)</tt>
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Each of these methods returns an AsyncRequestID value, which is a handle that may
                be used to cancel or abandon the operation if desirable (see the
                <A HREF="extended-operations.html">Using Standard Extended Operations</A> document
                for information about the cancel extended operation).  The
                <tt>AsyncResultListener.ldapResultReceived</tt> method will be called whenever the
                SDK receives the response for the operation.
              </p>

              <p>
                The API for processing compare operations is virtually identical to that for write
                operations, with the exception that the
                <tt>AsyncCompareResultListener.compareResultReceived</tt> method is used to provide
                access to the <tt>CompareResult</tt> object.  The method for processing an
                asynchronous compare operation is:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <tt>public AsyncRequestID asyncCompare(CompareRequest compareRequest,
                   AsyncCompareResultListener resultListener)</tt>
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                There is a greater difference in the API for performing asynchronous search
                operations.  Rather than providing a result listener as a separate argument, the
                given search request object must be configured with an
                <tt>AsyncSearchResultListener</tt> object as its <tt>SearchResultListener</tt>.
                The method to use to process an asynchronous search operation is:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <tt>public AsyncRequestID asyncSearch(SearchRequest searchRequest)</tt>
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java does not provide support for processing bind or
                extended operations in an asynchronous manner.  Further, it should be noted that a
                connection obtained from a connection pool should not be used to process
                asynchronous operations unless that connection is explicitly checked out of the
                pool and the caller is sure to wait for the response to arrive before returning the
                connection with the <tt>releaseConnection</tt> method, or if the response did not
                arrive in a timely manner then the <tt>releaseDefunctConnection</tt> method should
                be used to destroy the connection.
