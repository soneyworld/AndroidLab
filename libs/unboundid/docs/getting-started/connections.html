              <h2>Creating and Using LDAP Connections</h2>

              <p>
                The fundamental mechanism for interacting with LDAP directory servers is the
                <tt>com.unboundid.ldap.sdk.LDAPConnection</tt> object.  It maintains a socket for
                communicating with the server, maintains basic session state information, and
                provides methods for performing LDAP operations.
              </p>

              <p></p>
              <h3>Creating LDAP Connections</h3>

              <p>
                The <tt>LDAPConnection</tt> class has a number of constructors.  Some of them may
                be used to create a new connection that isn't actually connected to any server.
                Others may be used to establish an unauthenticated connection, and still others may
                be used to establish connections and perform simple authentication.
              </p>

              <p>
                Constructors which do not establish any connection:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li><tt>LDAPConnection()</tt></li>
                <li><tt>LDAPConnection(LDAPConnectionOperations connectionOptions)</tt></li>
                <li><tt>LDAPConnection(SocketFactory socketFactory)</tt></li>
                <li><tt>LDAPConnection(SocketFactory socketFactory, LDAPConnectionOptions connectionOptions)</tt></li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Constructors which establish an unauthenticated connection:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li><tt>LDAPConnection(String host, int port)</tt></li>
                <li><tt>LDAPConnection(LDAPConnectionOperations connectionOptions, String host, int port)</tt></li>
                <li><tt>LDAPConnection(SocketFactory socketFactory, String host, int port)</tt></li>
                <li><tt>LDAPConnection(SocketFactory socketFactory, LDAPConnectionOptions connectionOptions, String host, int port)</tt></li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Constructors which can establish an authenticated connection:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li><tt>LDAPConnection(String host, int port, String bindDN, String password)</tt></li>
                <li><tt>LDAPConnection(LDAPConnectionOptions connectionOptions, String host, int port, String bindDN, String password)</tt></li>
                <li><tt>LDAPConnection(SocketFactory socketFactory, String host, int port, String bindDN, String password)</tt></li>
                <li><tt>LDAPConnection(SocketFactory socketFactory, LDAPConnectionOptions connectionOptions, String host, int port, String bindDN, String password)</tt></li>
              </ul>

              <p></p>
              <h3>LDAP Connection Options</h3>

              <p>
                The <tt>com.unboundid.ldap.sdk.LDAPConnectionOptions</tt> object provides an object
                which can be used to control a number of low-level behaviors for the SDK.
                Properties that can be configured using <tt>LDAPConnectionOptions</tt> options
                include:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Whether a connection should attempt to automatically reconnect if the connection
                  is unexpectedly lost.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Whether a connection should attempt to automatically follow referrals returned
                  from the server.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  A maximum timeout for attempting to establish a connection.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  A maximum timeout for waiting for operation responses.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Socket options, like SO_KEEPALIVE, SO_LINGER, SO_REUSEADDR, and TCP_NODELAY.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  A mechanism for handling unsolicited notifications from the directory server.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  A mechanism for being notified when a connection is closed.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p></p>
              <h3>Creating SSL-Based Connections</h3>

              <p>
                The <tt>LDAPConnection</tt> constructors which take a
                <tt>javax.net.SocketFactory</tt> argument allow the connection to use special types
                of sockets for the underlying communication.  By default, connections will use a
                socket factory which creates standard, clear-text connections.  However, it is
                possible to use alternate forms of communication by specifying an alternate socket
                factory.  If you provide a socket factory capable of creating SSL-based sockets,
                then the communication with the server will be secured.
              </p>

              <p>
                The standard way to obtain SSL-based connections is to use an instance of the
                <tt>javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory</tt> class, perhaps one created by the
                <tt>getSocketFactory()</tt> method of a <tt>javax.net.ssl.SSLContext</tt> instance.
                This provides a great deal of flexibility and security, although it may require
                additional configuration to be able to trust the server certificate, or potentially
                to present a client certificate to the server for use in SASL EXTERNAL
                authentication.  See the Java security documentation for information on creating
                <tt>SSLContext</tt> and <tt>SSLSocketFactory</tt> objects.
              </p>

              <p>
                The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java includes a set of classes that help make it easier
                to obtain socket factories for performing SSL-based communication.  The
                <TT>com.unboundid.util.ssl.SSLUtil</TT> class provides an interface that may be
                used to easily create SSL socket factories (or SSL contexts for use with the
                StartTLS extended operation).  It can be easily configured to automatically trust
                any certificate, obtain trust information from a key store file, or interactively
                prompt the user about whether to trust a given certificate.  It also simplifies the
                process for accessing client certificates in key store files or PKCS#11 tokens.
              </p>

              <p></p>
              <h3>Connecting Unestablished Connections</h3>

              <p>
                If a connection is created with a constructor that does not actually establish a
                session with a target server, then one of the <tt>connect</tt> methods may be used
                to establish a connection to a directory server.  There are two variants of this
                method:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li><tt>connect(String host, int port)</tt></li>
                <li><tt>connect(String host, int port, int timeout)</tt></li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                If a timeout is specified, the value should be in milliseconds.  If no timeout is
                specified, then the default connection timeout from the associated
                <tt>LDAPConnectionOptions</tt> object will be used.
              </p>

              <p></p>
              <h3>Closing Connections</h3>

              <p>
                An established connection may be closed using one of the <tt>close()</tt> methods.
                If the connection is not established, then no action will be taken.  Otherwise, an
                unbind request will be sent to the server and the connection will be terminated.
                The connection may then be discarded, or it may be re-used by calling one of the
                <tt>connect</tt> methods to establish a new connection to the same or a different
                server.
              </p>

              <p>
                Note that <tt>LDAPConnection</tt> objects do provide a <tt>finalize()</tt> method
                so that the connection will automatically be terminated if it is still established
                at the time that the garbage collector determines that there are no more references
                to it.  However, it is strongly recommended that connections be explicitly closed
                when they are no longer needed in order to avoid the possibility of running out of
                available connections on the server or file descriptors on the client.
