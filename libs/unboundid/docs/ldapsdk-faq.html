              <h3>What is the UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java?</h3>

              <p>
                The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java is a fast, powerful, user-friendly, and completely
                free Java API for communicating with LDAP directory servers.  It is an alternative
                to other APIs like JNDI, the Netscape Directory SDK for Java, and JLDAP.  If you
                need to perform LDAP communication (or perform other directory-related processing
                like reading and writing LDIF files), then this is the API that you should be
                using.

              <h3>What advantages does the UnboundID LDAP SDK have over other LDAP APIs?</h3>

              <p>
                The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java provides a number of advantages over other
                Java-based LDAP APIs.  See <a href="advantages/index.html">this document</a>
                for a detailed overview of the advantages that our LDAP SDK provides over the
                alternatives, including a single-page
                <a href="advantages/comparison.html">comparison</a> that summarizes many of the
                benefits.

                <a href="http://www.unboundid.com/products/ldapsdk/">http://www.unboundid.com/products/ldapsdk/</a>.

              <p>
                The LDAP SDK documentation (including this FAQ) is included with the LDAP SDK in
                the "<tt>docs</tt>" directory.  The documentation for the latest release is also
                available online at

              <h3>Does the LDAP SDK work with any LDAP directory server?</h3>

              <p>
                Yes.  The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java supports the standard LDAP protocol, and
                will work with any directory server that supports LDAPv3.  Note that LDAP is an
                extensible protocol and there are a number of optional features.  Not all
                directory servers support all of the features offered by the LDAP SDK, and some
                directories may provide controls, extended operations, or SASL mechanisms not
                explicitly supported by the LDAP SDK (although the LDAP SDK is also extensible and
                it is possible to add support for custom controls, extended operations, and SASL
                mechanisms that it doesn't provide out of the box).

              <h3>What LDAP specifications does the LDAP SDK support?</h3>

              <p>
                The LDAP SDK provides full support for the core LDAPv3 protocol as described in
                <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2251.txt">RFC 2251</a> and updated in
                <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4511.txt">RFC 4511</a>.  It also supports a
                number of controls, extended operations, and other capabilities described in a
                number of other RFCs and IETF drafts.  See
                <a href="advantages/specifications.html">this page</a> for information about some
                of the specifications supported by the LDAP SDK.

              <h3>Does the LDAP SDK support LDAPv2?</h3>

              <p>
                No, it does not.  LDAPv2 is an older version of the protocol with a much more
                limited feature set than LDAPv3 and using a somewhat arcane encoding.  It was
                declared "historic" by
                <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3494.txt">RFC 3494</a> in 2003 and shouldn't
                be used for new development.

                Yes.  You can redistribute the UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java with your application.
                The only requirements are that you include the appropriate license file (one or

              <p>
                The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java Standard Edition is available under three
                licenses:  the <a href="LICENSE-GPLv2.txt">GNU General Public License version 2
                (GPLv2)</a>, the <a href="LICENSE-LGPLv2.1.txt">GNU Lesser General Public License

                  choose for my application?</h3>

              <p>
                We want to make it as easy and painless as possible to use the UnboundID LDAP SDK,
                so we have three licenses that should cover a broad range of possible use cases.

              <p>
                The <a href="LICENSE-GPLv2.txt">GPLv2</a> is a popular OSI-approved open source
                license, and if your application is licensed under GPLv2 or a compatible license,
                then you should choose this license.
              </p>

              <p>
                The <a href="LICENSE-LGPLv2.1.txt">LGPLv2.1</a> is similar to the GPLv2, but it is
                designed to be compatible with a wider range of licenses, including those for
                proprietary or closed-source applications.  If you wish to use the LDAP SDK under
                an OSI-approved open source license but your license is not compatible with the
                terms of the GPLv2, then you should choose this license.

                The <a href="LICENSE-UnboundID-LDAPSDK.txt">UnboundID LDAP SDK Free Use License</a>
                is not an OSI-approved open source license, but has been designed to be compatible

                The current version of the LDAP SDK is very stable and is suitable for use in
                production applications.  We have developed an extensive test suite specifically
                for the LDAP SDK, and it also undergoes significant testing as it is used in our
                other products.

              <h3>Is backward compatibility maintained between releases?</h3>

              <p>
                Whenever possible, we will avoid making incompatible changes in the LDAP SDK.  In
                fact, we have unit tests in place which compare the current API against that of
                previous releases to ensure that no incompatibilities have been introduced.
                However, if there is sufficient justification, we reserve the right to break
                backward compatibility under the following conditions:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  For any new additions to the API, we reserve the right to make incompatible
                  changes within the same minor version if there is sufficient justification.  For
                  example, if a new class is added in version 1.2.3, then that API may be changed
                  in incompatible ways in subsequent 1.2.x releases, but it should be considered
                  stable in 1.3.x and later releases.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  For any established APIs, we reserve the right to make incompatible changes
                  between major versions if there is sufficient justification.  For example, it is
                  possible that if there is a strong enough reason to do so then we may change
                  the interface for a class between 2.x.y and the 3.0.0 releases.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                In the event that we do make such an incompatible change, it will be documented in
                the release notes for the new version.

              <a name="threadsafe"></a>
              <h3>Is the LDAP SDK threadsafe?</h3>

              <p>
                The LDAP SDK has been designed to be highly concurrent and scalable.  As much of
                the LDAP SDK has been made threadsafe as is possible to do without adversely
                impacting performance or flexibility.  Connections can be used to process multiple
                requests at the same time as long as none of them does something that will impact
                the state of that connection (e.g., tries to close or re-establish the connection,
                tries to perform a bind, or tries to initiate StartTLS negotiation).
              </p>

              <p>
                The <tt>com.unboundid.util.ThreadSafety</tt> annotation type may be used to
                determine whether a given class or interface is threadsafe.  All public classes
                and interfaces in the LDAP SDK should be marked with this annotation type to
                indicate whether instances may be safely accessed via multiple threads at the
                same time.  This annotation type appears in the generated javadoc documentation,
                and for special cases in which a class may be partially threadsafe (like the
                <tt>LDAPConnection</tt> caveats mentioned above) the class-level documentation
                provides additional information about how such objects may be used concurrently.

              <a name="extensible"></a>
              <h3>Is the LDAP SDK extensible?</h3>

              <p>
                The LDAP SDK does provide various forms of extensibility.  In particular, it
                contains a number of non-final classes that may be extended to provide additional
                functionality.  It is possible to define custom controls, extended requests and
                results, SASL mechanisms, matching rules, server sets, and command-line tools by
                extending classes provided by the LDAP SDK.
              </p>

              <p>
                Similarly, the LDAP SDK provides a number of interfaces that may be implemented
                by third-party code for various purposes, including notification of certain types
                of events or messages received from the server, establishing connections for
                following referrals, and transforming entries read from LDIF files.
              </p>

              <p>
                However, the LDAP  SDK also includes a number of interfaces and non-final classes
                that are intended to be extended only by code within the LDAP SDK itself and not
                by third-party code outside of the LDAP SDK.  To help developers distinguish which
                classes and interfaces may be extended by external code and which are only allowed
                for classes in the LDAP SDK itself, all public interfaces and all non-final public
                classes have been updated to include an annotation which indicates whether new
                implementations may be provided in third-party code.  If a class or interface
                contains the <tt>@Extensible</tt> annotation, then it is safe for third-party code
                to extend.  Conversely, if a class or interface contains the
                <tt>@NotExtensible</tt> annotation then it is not intended to be implemented by
                code outside of the LDAP SDK (although objects of that type may be used by
                third-party code).  These annotations are visible in the generated Javadoc
                documentation.

              <h3>How do I create a connection to an LDAP directory server?</h3>

              <p>
                The <tt>com.unboundid.ldap.sdk.LDAPConnection</tt> class provides the main API for
                communicating with LDAP directory servers.  To create a new
                <tt>LDAPConnection</tt> object, establish the connection, and authenticate to the
                directory server, you can use code like:
              </p>

              <pre>
LDAPConnection connection = new LDAPConnection();
connection.connect("server.example.com", 389);
connection.bind("uid=john.doe,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com", "password');
</pre>

              <p>
                You can also create the connection and establish it at the same time, like:
              </p>

              <pre>
LDAPConnection connection = new LDAPConnection("server.example.com", 389);
connection.bind("uid=john.doe,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com", "password');
</pre>

              <p>
                And you can also do all three in a single step:
              </p>

              <pre>
LDAPConnection connection = new LDAPConnection("server.example.com", 389,

              <a name="secure"></a>
              <h3>How do I create secure connections?</h3>

              <p>
                The LDAP SDK supports the use of SSL and StartTLS for secure communication.  SSL
                should be used to create connections that are always secure (and will generally
                use a different port from that used for LDAP communication, typically port 636).
                StartTLS may be used to add security to an existing insecure connection (and will
                communicate over the same port used for insecure LDAP communication, typically
                port 389).  In both cases, the <tt>com.unboundid.util.ssl.SSLUtil</tt> class may
                be used to help configure the underlying security layer.
              </p>

              <p>
                In order to create an SSL-based connection, you should provide a custom socket
                factory when establishing the connection.  For example, the following code may be
                used to establish an SSL-based connection that will blindly trust any certificate
                that the Directory Server provides:
              </p>

              <pre>
SSLUtil sslUtil = new SSLUtil(new TrustAllTrustManager());

                In order to use the StartTLS extended operation to add encryption to an existing

              <a name="search"></a>
              <h3>How do I perform searches?</h3>

              <p>
                There are two primary ways in which you can perform searches in a synchronous
                manner.  For simple searches that are expected to match a small number of
                entries, you can allow the SDK to capture all of the entries in a list that it
                will make available in the <tt>SearchResult</tt> object that is returned.
                For example:
              </p>

              <pre>
SearchResult searchResult = connection.search("dc=example,dc=com",
     SearchScope.SUB, "(uid=john.doe)");
System.out.println(searchResult.getEntryCount() + " entries returned.");
for (SearchResultEntry e : searchResult.getSearchEntries())
{
  System.out.println(e.toLDIFString());
  System.out.println();
}
</pre>

              <p>
                For searches that are expected to match a large number of entries, or that may
                take a long time to complete and you want to ensure that entries are processed as
                quickly as they are returned, then you can implement the
                <tt>com.unboundid.ldap.sdk.SearchResultListener</tt> interface.  This interface
                contains methods that will be called whenever a search result entry or reference
                is returned by the server for the search.  The <tt>LDAPConnection.search</tt>
                method will still block until the search has completed.  For example:
              </p>

              <pre>
// The searchEntryReturned method of the provided searchListener will be
// invoked for each entry returned.  The searchReferenceReturned method of the
// searchListener will be invoked for each reference returned.  The call to
// the LDAPConnection.search method will not return until the search has
// completed, and the entries will not be available in the result, although the
// number of entries returned will still be included.
SearchResult searchResult = connection.search(searchListener,
     "dc=example,dc=com", SearchScope.SUB, "(givenName=John)");
System.out.println(searchResult.getEntryCount() + " entries returned.");
</pre>

              <hr>

              <a name="modify"></a>
              <h3>How do I modify entries?</h3>

              <p>
                The <tt>com.unboundid.ldap.sdk.Modification</tt> class may be used to describe the
                change or set of changes that should be made to a single attribute.  A modify
                operation may be processed using one or more modifications, like:
              </p>

              <pre>
Modification modification = new Modification(ModificationType.REPLACE,
     "description", "This is the new description for the user");
LDAPResult result = connection.modify(
     "uid=john.doe,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com", modification);
</pre>

              <p>
                As a convenience, it is also possible to process modifications using the LDIF
                representation, with a separate value per line of the LDIF.  For example:
              </p>

              <pre>
LDAPResult result = connection.modify(
     "dn: uid=john.doe,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com",
     "changetype: modify",
     "replace: description",
     "description: This is the new description for the user");
</pre>

              <hr>

              <a name="add"></a>
              <h3>How do I add new entries?</h3>

              <p>
                Entries can be added using a distinguished name and collection of attributes,
                like:
              </p>

              <pre>
Attribute[] attributes =
{
  new Attribute("objectClass", "top", "person", "organizationalPerson",
       "inetOrgPerson"),
  new Attribute("uid", "john.doe"),
  new Attribute("givenName", "John"),
  new Attribute("sn", "Doe"),
  new Attribute("cn", "John Doe")
};
LDAPResult result = connection.add("uid=john.doe,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com",
     attributes);
</pre>

              <p>
                As with the modify operation, add operations can be processed using the LDIF
                representation of the entry to add.  For example:
              </p>

              <pre>
LDAPResult result = connection.add(
     "dn: uid=john.doe,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com",
     "objectClass: top",
     "objectClass: person",
     "objectClass: organizationalPerson",
     "objectClass: inetOrgPerson",
     "uid: john.doe",
     "givenName: John",
     "sn: Doe",
     "cn: John Doe");

              <a name="pool"></a>
              <h3>How do I use connection pools?</h3>

              <p>
                The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java provides support for connection pools that can be
                used to maintain multiple connections to a directory server, or even multiple
                connections spread across multiple directory servers.  The easiest way to create a
                connection pool is to provide an established (and optionally authenticated)
                connection to use as the template for creating new connections and the initial and
                maximum number of connections that should be maintained in the pool.  For example:
              </p>

              <pre>
LDAPConnection connection = new LDAPConnection("server.example.com", 389,
     "uid=john.doe,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com", "password");
LDAPConnectionPool pool = new LDAPConnectionPool(connection, 1, 10);
</pre>

              <p>
                As with traditional connection pool implementations, it is possible to check out
                a connection, do something with it, and return it back to the pool, like:
              </p>

              <pre>
LDAPConnection connection = pool.getConnection();
try
{
  SearchResult searchResult = connection.search("dc=example,dc=com",
       SearchScope.SUB, "(objectClass=*)");
  // Do something with the result.
  pool.releaseConnection(connection);
}
catch (LDAPSearchException lse)
{
  // The search failed.  See if the connection is still valid and either
  // release it back to the pool or notify the pool that it is no longer valid
  // so that it will create a new one in its place.
  if (ResultCode.isConnectionUsable(lse.getResultCode()))
  {
    pool.releaseConnection(connection);
  }
  else
  {
    pool.releaseDefunctConnection(connection);
  }
}
</pre>

              <p>
                However, it is also possible to perform operations in the context of the
                connection pool without the need to explicitly check out the connection and
                perform all of the appropriate error handling.  The <tt>LDAPConnectionPool</tt>
                class implements the same interface (<tt>LDAPInterface</tt>) as the
                <tt>LDAPConnection</tt> class, so it is possible to perform operations against
                a pool in much the same way as with a single connection.  For example, the
                following is the logical equivalent to the above search:
              </p>

              <pre>
SearchResult searchResult = pool.search("dc=example,dc=com", SearchScope.SUB,
     "(objectClass=*)");
// Do something with the result.
</pre>

              <a name="asynchronous"></a>
              <h3>How do I process asynchronous operations?</h3>

              <p>
                The LDAP SDK provides relatively simple interfaces that may be used to process
                add, compare, delete, modify, modify DN, and search operations in an asynchronous
                manner.  In this case, the LDAP SDK will return control to the caller immediately
                after sending the request to the server without waiting for the response.  This
                allows the client to perform other processing in the meantime, and it will be
                notified when the response message(s) arrive for that operation.
                <a href="getting-started/asynchronous.html">This page</a> describes
                the process for performing asynchronous operations in the LDAP SDK.

              <a name="ldif"></a>
              <h3>How do I read and write LDIF files?</h3>

              <p>
                The <tt>com.unboundid.ldif</tt> package provides classes that may be used to read
                and write entries and change records using the LDAP Data Interchange Format (LDIF)
                syntax.  The <tt>LDIFReader</tt> class can be used to read entries and change
                records, and the <tt>LDIFWriter</tt> class can be used to write them.  The
                following code provides a simple example demonstrating the process that could be
                used to read entries from one file and write them to another:
              </p>

            <pre>
LDIFReader ldifReader = new LDIFReader("/path/to/source.ldif");
LDIFWriter ldifWriter = new LDIFWriter("/path/to/target.ldif");
while (true)
{
  Entry entry = ldifReader.readEntry();
  if (entry == null)
  {
    // There are no more entries to be read.
    break;
  }
  ldifWriter.writeEntry(entry);
}
ldifReader.close();
ldifWriter.close();
